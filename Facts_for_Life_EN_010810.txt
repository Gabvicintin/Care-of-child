Nearly 9 million children died in 2008 from preventable illnesses before reaching their ﬁfth
birthday – more than two thirds of them during the ﬁrst year of life. Millions more survive
only to face diminished lives, unable to develop to their full potential.
Five diseases – pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, measles and AIDS – together account for
half of all deaths of children under 5 years old. Undernutrition is a contributing cause of
more than one third of these deaths.
It is possible to save lives and greatly reduce human suffering by expanding low-cost
prevention, treatment and protection measures. The challenge is to ensure that this
knowledge is shared with parents, caregivers and communities, who are the ﬁrst line of
defence in protecting children from illness and harm.
Facts for Life has been developed as a vital resource for those who need it most. It delivers
essential information on how to prevent child and maternal deaths, diseases, injuries
and violence.
Since Facts for Life was ﬁrst released in 1989, countless families and communities around
the world have put its messages and guidance into practice. These efforts over the
years have contributed signiﬁcantly to progress on key global indicators such as health,
education, life expectancy, and infant and maternal morbidity and mortality. Much can be
achieved by empowering families and communities to adopt behaviours that improve child
survival, growth, learning, development and protection, while also promoting children’s and
women’s rights.
The fourth edition of Facts for Life expands on previous editions and contains several
signiﬁcant changes. For example, because of the inextricable link between the health of
the mother and the health of the child, a Newborn Health section has been included in the
Safe Motherhood chapter.
A chapter on Child Protection has also been added, which focuses on the vulnerabilities of
children and the actions needed to ensure that they grow up in supportive environments in
the home, school and community.

iv Facts for Life

Facts for Life provides information to help save, improve and protect children’s lives, and
should be shared widely with families, health workers, teachers, youth groups, women’s
groups, community organizations, government ofﬁcials, employers, trade unions, media,
and non-governmental and faith-based organizations.
Facts for Life is designed to educate those who have inﬂuence over the safety and wellbeing of children. Through simple messages, it aims to bring life-saving knowledge to every
corner of the world.

Facts for Life aims to provide families and communities with the information they need to
save and improve the lives of children. Parents, grandparents, other caregivers and young
people can refer to this practical source of information for answers to their questions related
to childbearing and getting children off to the best start in life. The challenge is to ensure that
everyone knows and understands these facts and is motivated to put them into practice.
The messages contained in Facts for Life are based on the latest scientiﬁc ﬁndings by
medical and child development experts around the world. These facts are presented in
simple language so they can be understood and acted upon easily by people without a
scientiﬁc background. Doing so can save lives.
The Facts for Life messages are also based on human rights, particularly the Convention on
the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women.
The messages empower people to fulﬁl the rights of their children. They also are aimed
at enabling women, young people and children to exercise and speak out in favour of
their rights.
Everyone can help communicate the Facts for Life messages — health workers, teachers,
social workers, government ofﬁcials, broadcasters, journalists, community workers,
religious and political leaders, mothers, fathers, grandparents, other family members,
friends, neighbours, students and people in all walks of life — young and old, men and
women, and girls and boys.

Facts for Life consists of 14 chapters ﬁlled with practical information about how to ensure
children’s rights to survival, growth, development and well-being. The topics address
pregnancy, childbirth, major childhood illnesses, child development, early learning,
parenting, protection, and care and support of children.
Each chapter has three parts: an introduction, key messages and supporting information.
THE INTRODUCTION is a brief ‘call to action’. It summarizes the extent of the problem and
the importance of taking action. The introduction aims to inspire people to get involved
and share this information widely. It can be used to motivate political leaders and the
mass media.
THE KEY MESSAGES, addressed to parents and other caregivers, are the essence of
Facts for Life. They contain the essential information that people need to protect their
children. The key messages are clear, brief and practical, so people can easily understand
them and take the recommended action. These messages are meant to be communicated
often and in various ways through multiple channels of communication.
THE SUPPORTING INFORMATION elaborates on each key message, providing additional
details and advice. This information is particularly useful for community-based workers,
health workers, social workers, teachers and families – anyone who wants to know more
about the survival, growth, development and protection of infants and children. It can be
used to answer questions from parents and other caregivers.

1.

The health of women1 and children can be signiﬁcantly improved when births are
spaced at least two years between the birth of the last child and the beginning of the
next pregnancy. Health risks increase for both the mother and the child when pregnancy
occurs before age 18 or after age 35. Both men and women, including adolescents,
need to know about the health beneﬁts of family planning so they can make
informed choices.

2.

All pregnant women should visit a trained health worker for prenatal and post-natal
care, and all births should be assisted by a skilled birth attendant. All pregnant women
and their families need to know the warning signs of problems during and after
pregnancy and the options for seeking assistance. They also need to have plans and
resources for obtaining skilled care for the birth and immediate help if problems arise.

3.

Children learn from the moment of birth. They grow and learn best when they receive
attention, affection and stimulation, in addition to good nutrition and proper health care.
Encouraging girls and boys equally to observe and express themselves and to play and
explore helps them learn and develop socially, physically, emotionally and intellectually.

4.

Breastmilk alone is the best food and drink for an infant for the ﬁrst six months of life.
After six months, infants need other nutritious foods, in addition to breastfeeding up to
two years and beyond, to meet their growth and development needs.

5.

Poor nutrition during the mother’s pregnancy or the child’s ﬁrst two years can slow a
child’s mental and physical development for life. Children need a well-balanced diet that
includes protein and energy foods as well as vitamins and minerals, such as iron and
vitamin A, to ensure good health and development. From birth to age 1, children should
be weighed every month and from age 1 to age 2, at least every three months. If a child
does not appear to be growing, the child should be seen by a trained health worker.

6.

Every child should complete the recommended series of immunizations. Immunizations
during a child’s ﬁrst year of life and into the second year are especially important for
early protection against diseases that can cause poor growth, disability or death. All
women of childbearing age, including adolescent girls, need to be protected against
tetanus for their own beneﬁt and for their future babies. Over time, ﬁve doses of tetanus
vaccine are recommended for lifelong protection. A booster should be given during
pregnancy if the woman has not yet received ﬁve doses.

7.

A child with diarrhoea needs plenty of the right liquids — breastmilk and ORS (oral
rehydration salts) solution – and, if older than 6 months, other nutritious liquids and
foods should be added. Zinc should be given to reduce the severity of the diarrhoea.

1

Throughout this publication, references to pregnant women include pregnant adolescents.

viii Facts for Life

If the diarrhoea is mixed with blood or is frequent and watery, the child is in danger and
should be taken to a trained health worker for immediate treatment.
8.

Most children with coughs or colds will get better on their own. But if a child with a
cough and fever is breathing rapidly or with difﬁculty, the child is in danger and needs
to be taken to a trained health worker for immediate treatment.

9.

Many illnesses can be prevented by good hygienic practices: washing hands with soap
and water (or a substitute, such as ash and water) after defecating or cleaning a child
who has defecated, using clean toilets or latrines, disposing of faeces away from play
and living areas and water sources, washing hands before handling food, using water
from a safe source, disinfecting drinking water if its safety is in question, and keeping
food and water clean.

10. Malaria, which is transmitted through mosquito bites, can be fatal. Wherever malaria is
present, people should sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito nets; any child with a
fever should be examined by a trained health worker for treatment and sponged gently
with cool (not cold) water; and pregnant women should take antimalarial tablets as
recommended by a trained health worker.
11. HIV (human immunodeﬁciency virus), the virus that causes AIDS (acquired
immunodeﬁciency syndrome), is preventable and treatable, but incurable. HIV is
transmitted through unprotected sex with an HIV-infected person; transmission from
an HIV-infected mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding;
and blood from HIV-contaminated syringes, needles or other sharp instruments
and transfusion with HIV-contaminated blood. Educating all people on HIV and
reducing stigma and discrimination should be part of the information, education and
communication on HIV prevention, testing and care. Early diagnosis and treatment
of children and adults can better ensure their survival and a longer and healthier life.
Children and families affected by HIV should have access to child-friendly health and
nutritional care and social welfare services. All people living with HIV should know
their rights.
12. Girls and boys should be equally protected within their family, school and community.
If these protective environments are lacking, children are more vulnerable to
violence, abuse, sexual exploitation, trafﬁcking, child labour, harmful practices and
discrimination. Living with family, birth registration, access to basic services, protection
from violence, a child-friendly justice system based on child rights, and children’s
active engagement in developing their knowledge and skills to protect themselves are
important building blocks in constructing protective environments in which children can
develop and fulﬁl their potential.
13. Many serious injuries that can result in disabilities or death can be prevented if parents
or other caregivers watch young children carefully, keep their environment safe and
teach them how to avoid accidents and injuries.
14. Families and communities must prepare for emergencies. In disasters, conﬂicts,
epidemics or pandemics, children and women must be the ﬁrst to receive attention,
including essential health care, adequate nutrition, support for breastfeeding and
protection from violence, abuse and exploitation. Children should have access to
recreation and learning opportunities in safe, child-friendly schools and spaces that give
them a sense of normalcy and stability. Children should be cared for by their parents or
other familiar adults, so that they feel secure.

Using Facts for Life can increase people’s knowledge and change their practices and
behaviour to improve and save children’s lives. This can lead to positive changes in social
beliefs and norms (what is considered normal by society) concerning the survival, growth,
learning, development, protection, care and support of children.
Facts for Life is both a practical source of information for individuals and an essential tool
for empowering individuals, young people, families and communities. Its messages and
information can promote dialogue, learning and communication among children, youth,
families, communities and social networks.
People from all walks of life can drive social change in favour of children’s rights. Working
together can make it possible to ﬁnd diverse, relevant, interesting and constructive ways of
using and communicating Facts for Life messages far and wide.
This guide for using Facts for Life provides:
●

some conceptual thinking on the process of behavioural and social change

●

information on using formative research and assessment to measure behaviour change
— research determines ‘baseline’ behaviours for use in helping to design and plan an
intervention or campaign aimed at changing behaviours
— assessment measures behaviour changes against the ‘baseline’ behaviours during or
following implementation of an intervention or campaign

●

practical guidance on how to use Facts for Life to promote behaviour and social change
that favours children’s right to survive, grow, learn, develop and achieve their full
potential in life.

x Facts for Life

Changing behaviours
Knowledge alone is insufﬁcient for behaviour change
It is often assumed that if people are provided with information, products (such as vaccines
or handpumps) and services (such as health or education), they will adopt healthier
behaviours.
However, information, products and services are often not enough to ensure adoption of
new behaviours.
It is important to go beyond giving people information. Facts for Life should be used in
consultation with children, families, communities and social networks. Their participation is
vital to inﬂuencing behavioural and social change in favour of children’s rights. Using Facts
for Life as a tool in communication and development interventions involves:
●

listening to the concerns of children, families and communities about the topics in Facts
for Life

●

communicating the messages and supporting information in Facts for Life in interesting
and constructive ways that are relevant to a particular context

●

stimulating dialogue among all concerned

●

supporting actions with children, families and communities that improve behaviours
related to the topics in Facts for Life

●

assessing the actions to determine behaviour change and outcomes.

Stages of behaviour change
As individuals, we go through different stages in changing our behaviour. These stages
include:
●

not being aware

●

becoming aware

●

becoming motivated to try something new

●

adopting a new behaviour

●

sustaining and ‘internalizing’ a new behaviour so that it becomes part of our normal
everyday practice.

First, we have to become aware that a particular behaviour may not be healthy for us or our
children. We then learn that there are other choices or alternative behaviours. We decide
to try a new behaviour. If we are satisﬁed that the new behaviour is beneﬁcial we may
repeat it. Ultimately, we may adopt it. Then we may advocate or promote it with others,
encouraging them to adopt it too.
Learning a new behaviour takes place in this continual cycle of awareness, experimentation
and repetition. For example, a father may be persuaded through talking with the local
religious leader to have his children sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito nets. He
then sees that the nets prevent mosquito bites and that his children do not get malaria.
He becomes an advocate for sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets, sharing his
experience with friends and urging them to use the nets.

Facts for Life xi

Sometimes people who appear to have adopted a new behaviour eventually reject it
and return to their former behaviour. For example, the father who was promoting use
of mosquito nets may start to feel that they are too much trouble, so he and his family
members stop using them. Returning to this old behaviour can harm the health of
his family.
Ensuring the adoption of a new behaviour that beneﬁts children and families requires an
integrated and sustained communication and development strategy. This involves using
different messages and methods to support the ‘change continuum’ of adopting the new
behaviour by individuals and families. The new behaviour may gradually be adopted by the
whole community so that, for example, everyone is using insecticide-treated mosquito nets.

Behaviour change creates a dynamic that may result in social change
Individuals rarely change all by themselves. Their behaviour often depends on and is
inﬂuenced by the views and practices of their families, friends and communities. Sometimes
these are positive, as when everybody washes their hands with soap and water after using
the toilet or latrine. Other times they may be harmful, as when parents have their daughters
undergo genital cutting or refuse to have their children vaccinated.
To change social behaviour means changing the
everyday views and practices of families and
communities. What parents, other caregivers,
children and adolescents decide to do is often
inﬂuenced by what others are doing around them.
Resistance can be expected when social norms are
challenged. This is because change involves shifting
the dynamics of a group on fundamental issues
related to gender roles, power relations and many
other factors within the family or community.

Eventually, the behaviour is considered normal practice by everyone.

xii Facts for Life

Knowing the ‘baseline’ behaviours
Conduct formative research to establish the ‘baseline’ behaviour(s)
Formative research is important in the design and planning stages of programming. It
helps to clarify the current situation and develop the objectives and baseline behaviour
information needed for subsequent measurement of behaviour change following
intervention(s). In so doing, it helps those involved and participating in the programming
identify and understand interests and concerns, reasons for speciﬁc behaviours, and what
particular needs and areas of child rights are inadequately addressed.
Conducting formative research involves the
gathering, review, analysis and synthesis of
available demographic, health, education,
sociocultural, political, economic, and media and
communication-related data and information using
a range of qualitative and quantitative research
methods. Research outcomes are best when the
data and information are gender disaggregated and
related to child rights/human rights. Using a gender
lens and a human rights approach can increase
awareness and improve and deepen understanding
of practices and behaviours affecting girls and boys
and their families and communities.

In Cameroon, Facts for Life
messages, translated into
Foufoulde, Gwaya, Haoussa
and Pidgin and
accompanied by related
images, are used in the
schools by the local
communication groups
(Cellules locales de
communication) and
Mothers’ Associations
(Associations des
mères d’élèves).

It is important that the research involve the
participation of children, families, communities
and researchers in order to collectively determine
the actions necessary to change behaviours to realize children’s rights. Research can be
organized and conducted by local academic institutions or research ﬁrms.

Use formative assessment to measure behavioural change
Formative assessment during and following implementation of interventions provides
updates on changes in the behaviours of individuals and families and even entire
communities. The behavioural changes can be measured against the baseline behaviours.
Simple research methods, such as surveys and focus group discussions, are an important
part of formative research and assessment. They can help ensure that local behaviour is well
understood and that chosen actions are supported collectively. Extra attention should be
given to ensure inclusion of the opinions of girls and boys, young people and women.
Establishing the baseline behaviours can make it easier to systematically and effectively
monitor and evaluate interventions and desired behaviour changes and outcomes. The
ﬁndings can help to produce constructive conclusions and recommendations for making
timely and strategic changes in programming.

Facts for Life xiii

Communicating Facts for Life messages
Examine the messages and supporting information in Facts for Life, and, if
necessary, adapt them to the local situation. Translate them where necessary.
Effectively communicate the messages and facilitate dialogue.
The text in Facts for Life should be examined and, if necessary, adapted in collaboration
with authorities (health, education, social services and so forth) to take into account locally
relevant issues. This should be done in consultation with family and community members.
In facilitating communication and dialogue with participant groups on the messages, give
attention to the following:
●

Ensure consideration of gender issues. In some settings, women may not be
empowered to make decisions about their children’s care or their own, or men may not
be encouraged to participate in child care and household chores.

●

Raise attention on children’s rights to help the
participant group identify and become aware of
behaviours related to children’s health, nutrition,
development, education and protection that may
have been overlooked.

In Honduras, a radio
broadcast about a new
ORS (oral rehydration
salts) product neglected
to mention that it was
for children suffering
from diarrhoea (locally
called empacho).
Mothers and fathers
did not understand it
was a treatment for
empacho because the
word was not used. This
underlines the necessity
of pretesting messages.

●

Involve children and young people in the dialogue
on the messages and information as well as the
planning and use of Facts for Life. Support peer-topeer approaches and different methods to increase
child participation.

●

When adapting or translating the messages
and information, use simple language and
illustrations that people understand. Do not
overload the messages with too many actions or
technical details.

●

Make sure the participant group understands the
messages and information and knows how to put
them into practice. If materials have been developed in a participatory manner, this will
be more easily done.

●

Always pretest the messages and illustrations with groups of people for whom they
are intended. This can be done by asking the test groups open-ended questions and
encouraging discussion to determine whether each message is clearly understood.

●

Repetition is vital! Most people do not learn or change behaviour after only one
discussion or exposure to a new behaviour.

●

Select communication channels that are most effective in reaching the participant
groups. Use existing channels and do not rely on a single means of communication.
Use a mix of interpersonal; community, traditional and ‘mid’ media; and mass
media so that people receive and discuss the messages repeatedly and in many
variations and circumstances. (Refer to the following section entitled Use a mix of
communication channels.)

xiv Facts for Life

Give people the opportunity to discuss, shape
and absorb new information for themselves and
their communities
People are more likely to trust information and to act
on it to change behaviours if:

In Senegal, Facts for
Life messages have
been used to promote
exclusive breastfeeding,
curb the spread of
cholera, advocate for the
abandonment of female
genital cutting and
encourage skin-to-skin
contact between mothers
and newborns (especially
for premature babies), in
addition to other babycare practices.

●

they are encouraged to discuss it among
themselves and to ask questions to clarify their
understanding

●

they understand how they and their families and
communities will beneﬁt

●

the language is familiar and compatible with
the local culture and social norms, avoiding
judgemental or prescriptive-sounding ‘orders’

●

the person presenting it or the source of
information (such as radio or television) is well
known and trusted

●

they hear repeated, simple and consistent messages from different sources

●

they are given time to change, especially if the change carries a cost, such as installation
of latrines.

Use a mix of communication channels: interpersonal; community, traditional
and ‘mid’ media; and mass media
Interpersonal: person-to-person
Most people are not comfortable using new information seen or heard in the mass media
without having an opportunity to discuss it with someone they trust. Person-to-person
communication, supplemented by mass and traditional and/or ‘mid’ media campaigns and
ongoing programming activities, are most effective in encouraging people to adopt, sustain
and internalize new behaviours.
Using Facts for Life effectively requires facilitating participant groups, especially the most
marginalized, to become engaged in meaningful dialogue. It is important to reach remote
communities, children with disabilities and minority or indigenous children and families. It is
also vital that women and girls participate as fully as men and boys.
To facilitate an interpersonal discussion:
●

Use simple examples of problems that are important to the people involved. Start
with what is already known and focus on major concerns. Avoid technical or scientiﬁc
language. Use illustrations to stimulate discussion.

●

Encourage people to ask questions and express concerns. Guide the discussion to
explore the causes of the problem and possible solutions. Remember to listen, which is
as important to communication as speaking. The participation of children, families and
other community members is key to identifying barriers or unforeseen problems that
prevent people from acting on the message. They can articulate local solutions.
Facts for Life xv

●

●

Show respect for people’s opinions, knowledge and
ability to change. People learn best in situations
that build their conﬁdence, and they take action
when they feel understood and respected. Be a
role model for the behaviour you would like to
see adopted.
Support people in taking action. Recognize that
they may want to change but may not be able to
act alone. Help them mobilize existing networks
or create new ones that will encourage more
individuals and families to adopt and sustain
new behaviours.

Community, traditional and ‘mid’ media
This type of communication refers to materials or
communication methods that are in between the
person-to-person approach and the mass audience
approach. Some examples include:
●

Street theatre: Used to deliver key messages by a
small group of actors for groups ranging from a
few dozen to hundreds of people.

●

Cell phone messages: Used to urge parents or
other caregivers to take their children for their
vaccinations, etc.

Bangladesh has been
using messages from
Facts for Life for nearly
20 years. Known as
Shasthyo Tothyo in
Bengali, it has become
a household name over
the years.
The messages
communicated through
many materials and
media have been widely
disseminated by and
among government
ofﬁcials, NGOs, teachers,
community workers,
medical students, child
rights committees,
women’s organizations,
local authorities, health
workers, nurses, artists
and theatre groups.
Facts for Life messages
have even shaped
curriculum content – once
a week, many primary
schools have one class
dedicated to information
from Facts for Life.

●

Internet: Used for communication and as a source
of information. The internet is expanding rapidly

Posters, leaﬂets and badges or buttons: Often used
to reinforce information communicated through
interpersonal contact or social mobilization efforts.

●

xvi Facts for Life

Mass media
Mass media (radio, newspapers and television)
are excellent tools for reaching large numbers
of people to introduce and reinforce new
information and promote a particular social
change. Some steps include:
●

●

Assist participant groups in identifying their
primary mass media channels. What is the
source of their information and news? If
community radio is as important to them as
national radio, ﬁnd ways to work with local
radio networks.
Publicize the same message in various media.
Repetition reinforces behaviour change,
strengthens memory and enhances learning.
This helps people retain the message and
encourages them to act on it. Examples of
media channels include interviews, news
articles, round-table discussions, radio or
television dramas, soap operas, puppet
shows, comics, jingles or songs, quizzes,
contests and call-in shows.

India’s number one television
drama series, Kyunki Jeena Issi
Ka Naam Hai, is based on Facts
for Life. Launched in 2008,
the series reaches 56 million
viewers who are mostly
women between 15 and 34
years old.
The show communicates Facts
for Life messages through
engaging stories. Viewers
relate the experiences of the
characters to their own lives.
Assessments in some states
have revealed that midwives
have been so inspired by the
show’s popular nurse character
that they feel more motivated
in their work. Facts for Life
messages have also reinforced
the midwives’ knowledge, for
example, regarding prenatal
check-ups.

●

Understand who in the household makes
decisions about what to listen to or watch,
and make sure the message targets them.

●

If the messages are aired on radio or
television, make sure they are broadcast at a time when families are listening or
watching. Do not rely only on free public service announcements aired during
off-peak hours.

●

Broadcast messages during popular programmes so they reach a wide audience. Ask
popular disc jockeys and television show hosts to discuss the messages on radio call-in
programmes or TV shows with live audiences.

Use of mixed communication methods produces the best results
To achieve behaviour change that favours the rights of all children, it is key to use a mix of
communication channels, combining short-term, campaign-style actions with long-term and
interactive communication.

Ensuring access to family planning services for women and men, and to education for all
children would help prevent many maternal and child deaths and disabilities, particularly
in countries where marriage occurs early in life. Together these measures can contribute to
women’s, adolescent girls’ and children’s right to survival, health and well-being.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Both women and men have the right to choose how many children to have and when to
have them. With family planning services they are enabled to make informed decisions on
pregnancy by taking into account the beneﬁts and risks, including those related to age and
level of access to health services.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Family planning is one of the most effective ways
to improve women’s and children’s health and
survival. Family planning services provide women
and men with information, education and the
means to plan when to begin having children,
how many to have, how far apart to have them
and when to stop. However, millions of women
of childbearing age, including adolescent girls, do
not have control over limiting pregnancies or spacing births, nor do they have access to
effective family planning methods.

Pregnancy before the age of 18 or after the age of 35 increases the health
risks for the mother and her baby.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Every year over 500,000 women die from pregnancy and childbirth
complications. For every woman who dies, approximately 20 more develop
infections and severe disabling problems – adding up to more than 10 million
women affected each year. Access to and use of family planning services
could prevent many of these deaths and disabilities.
Delaying a ﬁrst pregnancy until a girl is at least 18 years of age helps to
ensure a safer pregnancy and childbirth. It reduces the risk of her baby being
born prematurely and/or underweight. This is especially important where
early marriage is the custom and married adolescents face pressure to
become pregnant.
Childbirth is more likely to be difﬁcult and dangerous for an adolescent than
for an adult. Babies born to very young mothers are much more likely to die
in the ﬁrst year of life. Young adolescents do not yet have a fully developed
pelvis. Pregnancy for them can result in serious consequences, such as
eclampsia, premature labour, prolonged labour, obstructed labour, ﬁstula,
anaemia (thin blood) or infant and/or maternal death.

Adolescent girls and
young women, married or

to delay pregnancy. All who
might be involved with an
early pregnancy – adolescent
girls and young women and
adolescent boys and men as
well as their families – should
be aware of the risks involved
and how to avoid them. This
should include information
on how to prevent sexually

including HIV.

TIMING BIRTHS

The younger the mother is, the greater the risk to her and her baby. The risk
of maternal death related to pregnancy and childbirth for adolescent girls
between 15 and 19 years of age accounts for some 70,000 deaths each year.
For adolescents under 15 years of age these risks increase substantially. Girls
who give birth before age 15 are ﬁve times more likely to die in childbirth
than women in their twenties.

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

The risk of death for newborns and infants increases signiﬁcantly if the births
are not spaced. There is a higher chance that the new baby will be born too
early and weigh too little. Babies born underweight are less likely to grow
well, more likely to become ill and four times more likely to die in the ﬁrst
year of life than babies of normal weight.

One of the threats to the health and growth of a child under age 2 is the birth
of a sibling. For the older child, breastfeeding may stop, and the mother
has less time to prepare the foods and provide the care and attention the
child needs.
Whenever a new baby comes into the family, it is important for the father to
help the mother with the new baby and the other children. Both mothers and
fathers and other caregivers should give equal attention and care to both girls
and boys.
A mother’s body needs time to recover fully from pregnancy and childbirth.
She needs to regain her health, nutritional status and energy before she
becomes pregnant again.
If a woman has a miscarriage or abortion, she should wait at least six months
before becoming pregnant again in order to reduce the risk to herself and
her baby.
To protect the health of their families, men as well as women need to be
aware of the importance of (1) a two-year space between the birth of the last
child and the beginning of the next pregnancy and (2) the need to limit the
number of pregnancies.

Trained health workers and clinics should also provide adolescent girls and
boys with reproductive health information and family planning services that
are (1) sensitive to adolescents and (2) geared to help them develop their
skills to make healthy and responsible life decisions.

Adolescent boys and men can play a key role in preventing unplanned
(unintended) pregnancies. It is important that they have access to information
and services related to sexual and reproductive health.

Of the various contraceptive methods, only condoms protect against both
pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

BREASTFEEDING

The more formal education an adolescent girl or woman has, the more
likely she is to use reliable family planning methods, delay marriage and
childbearing, be better off economically and have fewer and healthier babies.
Enrolling and keeping girls in school is therefore extremely important for
maternal and child health, in addition to all the other beneﬁts of education.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Special channels to reach out to adolescent girls and pregnant adolescents
need to be developed to provide them with support which may include
counselling, contraceptives, and prenatal and post-natal services. Pregnant
adolescents require special attention and more frequent visits to the health
clinic for prenatal and post-natal care.

Trained health workers and clinics should offer information and advice to
empower women to make decisions about family planning and to help
women and men choose a family planning method that is acceptable, safe,
convenient, effective and affordable.

It is critical to educate adolescent boys, young men and men on their
responsibility regarding condom use. Adolescent girls and boys, married or
unmarried, need to know about the dual protection of a condom and another
kind of contraception (using two methods of contraception at the same time)
to help avoid pregnancy and prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including HIV.
In some countries, deaths related to abortion are high among adolescent
girls. Adolescent girls, young women and their partners should be provided
with information on pregnancy prevention and the risks associated with
abortion.
A mother who feeds her baby only with breastmilk, on demand day and
night during the baby’s ﬁrst six months, can delay the return of menstruation
and help prevent pregnancy. There is a small chance that she can become
pregnant before her periods return. The risk is less than 2 per cent, which is
similar to that of other family planning methods. However, this risk increases
after six months.

Most governments have ratiﬁed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women. Some countries have ratiﬁed the international agreements
on maternity protection, and most have enacted legislation on maternity protection.
These international agreements in defence of women’s rights include a legally binding

in the workplace.

Introduction 11

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Many women, including adolescents, have difﬁculty accessing quality health care due to
poverty, distance, lack of information, inadequate services or cultural practices. Governments
and local authorities, with support from non-governmental and community-based organizations,
have a responsibility to address these issues to ensure that women receive the quality health
care they need and that they and their newborns have a right to receive.

BREASTFEEDING

Governments have a responsibility to ensure that every woman has access to quality
maternity care, including prenatal and post-natal services; a skilled birth attendant to assist
at childbirth; special care and referral services in the event serious problems arise; and
maternity protection in the workplace.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

The risks of childbearing for the mother and her baby can be greatly reduced if: (1) a woman
is healthy and well nourished before becoming pregnant; (2) she has regular maternity
care by a trained health worker at least four times during every pregnancy; (3) the birth
is assisted by a skilled birth attendant, such as a doctor, nurse or midwife; (4) she and her
baby have access to specialized care if there are complications; and (5) she and her baby are
checked regularly during the 24 hours after childbirth, in the ﬁrst week, and again six weeks
after giving birth.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD
AND NEWBORN HEALTH

Each year, about 3 million babies are stillborn, and
3.7 million babies (latest data available, 2004) die
very soon after birth or within the ﬁrst month. The
poor health of the mother, including diseases that
were not adequately treated before or during pregnancy, is often a factor contributing to
newborn deaths or to babies born too early and/or with low birthweight, which can cause
future complications.

Girls who are educated and healthy and who have a nutritious diet
throughout their childhood and teenage years are more likely to have
healthy babies and go through pregnancy and childbirth safely if
childbearing begins after they are 18 years old.

2.

The risks associated with childbearing for the mother and her baby can be
greatly reduced if a woman is healthy and well nourished before becoming
pregnant. During pregnancy and while breastfeeding, all women need more
nutritious meals, increased quantities of food, more rest than usual, iron-folic
acid or multiple micronutrient supplements, even if they are consuming fortiﬁed
foods, and iodized salt to ensure the proper mental development of their babies.

3.

Every pregnancy is special. All pregnant women need at least four prenatal
care visits to help ensure a safe and healthy pregnancy. Pregnant women
and their families need to be able to recognize the signs of labour and the
warning signs of pregnancy complications. They need to have plans and
resources for obtaining skilled care for the birth and immediate help if
problems arise.

4.

Childbirth is the most critical period for the mother and her baby. Every
pregnant woman must have a skilled birth attendant, such as a midwife,
doctor or nurse, assisting her during childbirth, and she must also have
timely access to specialized care if complications should occur.

5.

Post-natal care for the mother and child reduces the risk of complications
and supports mothers and fathers or other caregivers to help their new
baby get a healthy start in life. The mother and child should be checked
regularly during the ﬁrst 24 hours after childbirth, in the ﬁrst week, and
again six weeks after birth. If there are complications, more frequent checkups are necessary.
12 Facts for Life

Violence against women is a serious public health problem in most
communities. When a woman is pregnant, violence is very dangerous to
both the woman and her pregnancy. It increases the risk of miscarriage,
premature labour and having a low-birthweight baby.

Girls who are educated and healthy and who have a nutritious diet
throughout their childhood and teenage years are more likely to have healthy
babies and go through pregnancy and childbirth safely if childbearing begins
after they are 18 years old.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Girls with more formal education are better equipped to fulﬁl their potential
in life. They tend to know about health-care practices and are less likely to
become pregnant at a very young age. They are more likely to marry later,
have fewer and better-spaced pregnancies, and seek prenatal and post-natal
care. It is estimated that two maternal deaths can be prevented for every
additional year of school attendance per 1,000 women.
The healthy growth and development of a girl through adolescence helps to
prepare her for healthy pregnancies during her childbearing years.
In addition to education and health care, girls need a nutritious diet during
childhood and adolescence to reduce problems later in pregnancy and
childbirth. A nutritious diet includes iodized salt and foods rich in essential
minerals and vitamins such as beans and other pulses, grains, green leafy
vegetables, and red, yellow and orange vegetables and fruits. Whenever
possible, milk or other dairy products, eggs, ﬁsh, chicken and meat should be
included in the diet.

14 Facts for Life

Girls who stay in school are more likely to delay marriage and childbirth.
Early pregnancy can have serious consequences for adolescents under 18
years old, particularly for those under 15 years old. Adolescent girls and their
babies are at much higher risk of complications and death.
It is important to empower girls to avoid early pregnancy and inform
both girls and boys about the risks of early pregnancy as well as sexually
transmitted infections, including HIV. They both need to develop the
skills to make healthy life choices that also support equality and respect
in relationships.

Health workers and community outreach programmes can help raise
awareness of harmful practices and the importance for adolescents to delay
marriage and pregnancy for their health and well-being.

Adolescent girls, women, pregnant women and new mothers need the best
foods available: milk, fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, ﬁsh, eggs, grains,
peas and beans. All of these foods are safe to eat during pregnancy and
while breastfeeding.

After childbirth, women also need nutritious meals and a greater quantity of

SAFE MOTHERHOOD
AND NEWBORN HEALTH

Genital cutting of girls and women can cause severe vaginal and urinary
infections that can result in sterility or death. It can also cause dangerous
complications during childbirth.

During prenatal visits, a trained health worker can provide the pregnant
woman with iron-folic acid or multiple micronutrient supplements to prevent
or treat anaemia. Malaria or hookworm infection can be treated if needed. The
health worker can also screen the pregnant woman for night blindness and,
as necessary, prescribe an adequate dosage of vitamin A to treat the woman
and contribute to the healthy development of the fetus.
If the pregnant woman thinks she has anaemia, malaria or hookworms, she
should consult a trained health worker.
Salt consumed by families should be iodized. Iodine in a pregnant woman’s
and young child’s diet is especially critical for the healthy development of the
child’s brain. Goitre, a swelling at the front of the neck, is a clear sign that the
body is not getting enough iodine. A diet low in iodine is especially damaging
during the early stages of pregnancy and in early childhood. Women who do
not have enough iodine in their diet are more likely to have an infant who is
mentally or physically disabled. Severe iodine deﬁciency can cause cretinism
(stunted physical and mental growth), stillbirth, miscarriage and increased
risk of infant mortality.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

When a young woman begins to be sexually active, she needs information
about pregnancy and the risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including HIV. She should be able to recognize the early signs of pregnancy.
If she becomes pregnant, she should be supported to receive prenatal care
early in the pregnancy from a trained health worker. She should learn about
the normal phases of pregnancy and how to keep herself and her baby
healthy during the pregnancy. She needs to know the warning signs of
serious pregnancy complications.
A pregnant woman needs at least four prenatal visits with a trained health
worker during every pregnancy. The ﬁrst prenatal visit should take place
as early as possible, ideally in the ﬁrst three months (the ﬁrst trimester)
of pregnancy, and the other three visits can be scheduled to take place at
predetermined times during the remainder of the pregnancy.

16 Facts for Life

To help ensure a safe and healthy pregnancy, a trained health worker or
skilled birth attendant should:

●

check for anaemia and provide iron-folic acid supplements, ensure that
the woman understands the importance of taking the supplements and
explain the normal side effects, including constipation and nausea

●

screen for night blindness to determine if the woman needs to be treated
with vitamin A and, if necessary, prescribe vitamin A to protect the mother
and promote the healthy development of the fetus

●

review the mother’s tetanus immunization status and give the dose(s)
needed to protect her and her newborn baby

●

encourage all pregnant women to use only iodized salt in food
preparation to help protect their children from mental and physical
disabilities and to protect themselves from goitre

●

encourage all pregnant women to have more nutritious meals, increased
quantities of food and more rest than usual

●

prescribe antimalarial tablets and recommend use of an insecticidetreated mosquito net where needed

●

prescribe deworming medication, as necessary, from the second trimester
onward to help reduce low birthweight

●

prepare the mother and father for the experience of childbirth and caring
for their newborn, give the mother advice on breastfeeding and caring for
herself, and provide the father with guidance on how he can assist

●

A pregnant woman who is HIV-positive should consult a trained health
worker for counselling on how to reduce the risk of infecting her baby during
pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding and how to care for herself and her
baby. A pregnant woman who thinks she may be infected with HIV should be
supported to get tested and receive counselling. The father-to-be should also
be tested and counselled (refer to the HIV chapter for more information).
Every pregnant woman and her family need to know that pregnancy and
childbearing can have risks. They should be able to recognize the warning signs.
It is generally recommended that women give birth in a facility and with a
skilled birth attendant, since complications cannot be predicted. For some
women, this is even more important because the possibility of complications
increases if they:
●

are under 18 or over 35 years of age

●

gave birth less than two years ago

●

have had several previous pregnancies

●

have had a previous premature birth or a baby weighing less than
2 kilograms at birth

●

have had a previous difﬁcult birth or Caesarean birth

●

have had a miscarriage or stillbirth

●

weigh less than 38 kilograms

●

are less than 1.5 metres tall

●

have been through inﬁbulation or genital cutting

●

have HIV or other STIs.

A pregnant woman should be supported to recognize the signs of labour and
know when it is time to seek a skilled birth attendant to assist with the birth.
The signs of labour include any one of the following:
●

painful contractions every 20 minutes or less

●

the water breaks

●

bloody, sticky discharge.

Warning signs during pregnancy include:
●

anaemia (symptoms include paleness of the tongue and inside the
eyelids, fatigue and shortness of breath)

●

unusual swelling of legs, arms or face

●

little or no movement of the fetus.

During the prenatal visits, the pregnant woman and her family should
be supported in preparing for the birth and possible complications by
developing a plan that speciﬁes:
where the woman will give birth and where she will go if complications
arise

●

who will accompany her

●

how she will get there

●

what supplies she needs to take for herself and her baby

complications should be updated during every prenatal care visit as the
pregnancy progresses.

All pregnant women should have access to a maternity clinic or hospital
when they give birth. This is particularly important if the woman and her
family are aware that the birth is likely to be difﬁcult. In some cases, where
distance and/or an expected risky birth are factors, it may be preferable to
have the mother-to-be move closer to the clinic or hospital as her due date
approaches so she is within quick reach of health services.

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Health workers, families and communities need to give special attention
to pregnant adolescents because they are at higher risk of pregnancy
complications and in some cases they may lack the inﬂuence to make family
decisions or ask for assistance.

The plan for emergency care in case of complications should include the
location of the nearest maternity clinic or hospital and the resources needed
to quickly get the woman there at any time of the day or night.

Childbirth is the most critical period for the mother and her baby. Every
pregnant woman must have a skilled birth attendant, such as a midwife,
doctor or nurse, assisting her during childbirth, and she must also have
timely access to specialized care if complications should occur.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Every pregnancy deserves attention because there is always a risk of something
going wrong with the mother, baby or both. Many dangers, illnesses or even
death can be avoided if the woman plans to give birth attended by a skilled birth
attendant, such as a doctor, nurse or midwife, and makes at least four prenatal
visits to a trained health worker during the pregnancy.
The likelihood of the mother or the baby becoming ill or dying is reduced
when childbirth takes place in a properly equipped health facility with the
assistance of a skilled birth attendant, who also checks regularly on the
mother and baby in the 24 hours after delivery.
When the pregnant woman is ready to give birth, she should be encouraged
to have a companion of her choice accompany her to provide her with
continuous support during childbirth and after birth. In particular, the
companion can support the woman in labour to eat and drink, use breathing
techniques for different stages of childbirth, and arrange for pain and
discomfort relief as needed and advised by the skilled birth attendant.
During and immediately following childbirth, the skilled birth attendant will:
●

assess and follow the progress of labour and pay attention to danger
signs that indicate help is needed immediately

●

advise the woman and her family if specialized care is needed and if a
transfer to a hospital or maternity centre is necessary

●

reduce the risk of infection by keeping hands, instruments and the
delivery area clean, and by using gloves at appropriate times

●

encourage the woman to walk during the ﬁrst stage of labour and support
her choice of position for childbirth

●

assist the different stages of labour and the birth of the baby

●

cut the umbilical cord at the appropriate moment and care for it

●

care for the baby and keep her or him warm after birth

●

guide the mother to put her baby on her chest for immediate skin-to-skin
contact and initiation of breastfeeding soon after birth

●

deliver the afterbirth (placenta) safely and care for the mother after the
baby is born

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Some babies may need extra care at a special care unit of a hospital until they
are sufﬁciently developed or well enough to go home with the parents. If a baby
is not yet able to breastfeed, the mother can express her milk and safely store it
so it can be fed to the baby using a sterilized feeding tube, spoon or cup.

Caring for a newborn brings joy to the mother and father as well as anxiety
and fatigue as they adjust to having full-time care of the new baby in their
lives. Since newborns are generally dependent on their parents to provide for
their every need, mothers and fathers need to take good care of themselves.
Breastfeeding mothers especially need to eat more nutritious food, and all
mothers should get more rest. A father can support the mother while she
breastfeeds by caring for the household and other children or by caring for
the newborn while she rests.

Smoking, alcohol, drugs, poisons and pollutants are particularly harmful to
pregnant women, the developing fetus, babies and young children.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

If a pregnant woman smokes, her child is more likely to be born underweight.
Her child is also more likely to have coughs, colds, croup, pneumonia or other
breathing problems.
A pregnant woman can damage her own health and the health of the fetus
by drinking alcohol or using narcotics. These substances can severely affect
a child’s physical and mental development. The mother-to-be should stop
drinking alcohol and/or taking drugs as soon as she plans a pregnancy or
suspects she is pregnant. If she has difﬁculty stopping, she should seek
medical advice and support from a trained health worker, a health centre or a
substance-abuse organization.
A pregnant woman should not take medicines during pregnancy unless they
are absolutely necessary and prescribed by a trained health worker.
To ensure proper physical growth and mental development of the child, women
of childbearing age, pregnant women, mothers and young children need to be
protected from smoke from tobacco or cooking ﬁres; from pesticides, herbicides
and other poisons; and from pollutants such as lead found in water transported
by lead pipes, in vehicle exhaust and in some paints.
Families and communities can especially help pregnant women, mothers and
their children by supporting smoke-free environments so they do not inhale
damaging secondary tobacco smoke.
Workplaces should protect women of childbearing age, pregnant women and
mothers from exposure to harmful smoke, poisons and pollutants that can
affect their health and that of their children.

Violence against women is a serious public health problem in most
communities. When a woman is pregnant, violence is very dangerous to both
the woman and her pregnancy. It increases the risk of miscarriage, premature
labour and having a low-birthweight baby.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Health workers, families and communities should be aware of these dangers,
provide protection, and work to prevent and eliminate violence against
women. Local authorities, with support from organizations and community
leaders, have the responsibility to: (1) take action to prevent violence against
women and challenge social norms that increase women’s risk for violence
and abuse; (2) enforce laws protecting women from violence and abuse; and
(3) provide accessible protection and support services for abused women.

9.

In the workplace, pregnant women and mothers should be protected from

Protective measures can include:
Maternity leave: A mother has the right to a period of rest when her child is
born, means to support herself and her family, and a guarantee that she can
return to work when her leave is ﬁnished.
Employment protection: This is a guarantee that pregnant women and
new mothers will not be discriminated against and lose their job or job
entitlements (pension, paid holiday leave, etc.) due to pregnancy, maternity
leave or time off for childbirth
Cash (income) support and medical beneﬁts: Working pregnant women
and mothers and their newborns and families generally need cash support
and medical care beneﬁts. Cash support replaces a portion of lost income
caused by the interruption of the women’s work due to pregnancy, childbirth
and newborn care. Medical beneﬁts are needed by pregnant women, new
mothers and newborns for prenatal, childbirth and post-natal services, and
hospitalization when necessary.
Health protection: The pregnant or nursing woman should not be obliged to
perform work that can affect her health or that of her child. Where there is a risk,
changes in her work conditions should be made to reduce workplace health
risks. The woman should return to her job when it is safe for her to do so, or she
should be provided with an equivalent job with the same remuneration.
Breastfeeding: Mothers should have the right to breastfeed a child after
returning to work, because breastfeeding has major beneﬁts for the health
of the mother and her child. Mothers should be entitled to take one or more
breaks, or a reduction in work hours for breastfeeding, which should not be
subtracted from her paid work time.

Every woman has the right to quality health care, especially a pregnant
woman or a new mother. Health workers should be technically competent
and sensitive to cultural practices and should treat all women, including
adolescent girls, with respect.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Many dangers of pregnancy and childbirth can be avoided if women
have access to quality health care during pregnancy and childbirth and
after childbirth.
All women have the right to the services of a skilled birth attendant, such as a
doctor, nurse or midwife, and to emergency care if complications should arise.

26 Facts for Life

Quality health care that offers information and counselling enables women
and men to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. A
woman in need of maternal care should be supported by her husband or
partner and family to take good care of herself and her baby and to reach a
health facility when needed, including for prenatal care, childbirth, post-natal
care and emergency care.

Health-care providers should be supported through regular training to
maintain and improve their technical and communication skills needed to
provide quality health care. They should be trained to treat all women with
respect, to be sensitive to cultural norms and practices, and to respect a
person’s right to conﬁdentiality and privacy. They need to be sensitive and
understanding of the particular needs of adolescents, and know how to
support and counsel them in caring for themselves and their babies.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD
AND NEWBORN HEALTH

Governments, with support from communities, should make sure that the
cost of health services does not prevent women, including adolescent girls,
from using them. Other barriers such as the cost of transport, long distances,
difﬁcult roads and cultural practices also need to be addressed to ensure
access to health services.

hild development refers to the changes
that occur as a child grows and develops in
relation to being physically healthy, mentally
alert, emotionally sound, socially competent and
ready to learn.

Recent research conﬁrms that the ﬁrst ﬁve years
are particularly important for the development of
the child’s brain, and the ﬁrst three years are the
most critical in shaping the child’s brain architecture. Early experiences provide the base for
the brain’s organizational development and functioning throughout life. They have a direct
impact on how children develop learning skills as well as social and emotional abilities.

Babies and young children grow, learn and develop rapidly when they receive love and
affection, attention, encouragement and mental stimulation, as well as nutritious meals and
good health care.
Understanding the stages of child development helps parents know what to expect and how
to best support the child as she or he grows and develops.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Children learn more quickly during their early years than at any other time in life. They need
love and nurturing to develop a sense of trust and security that turns into conﬁdence as
they grow.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

The ﬁrst ﬁve years of a child’s life are fundamentally
important. They are the foundation that shapes
children’s future health, happiness, growth,
development and learning achievement at school,
in the family and community, and in life in general.

In many settings, early childhood programmes support parents and their children from
infancy through age 8, which includes the important transition from home to school.

It is the duty of parents, other caregivers and family members, communities, civil society
and governments to ensure that these rights are respected, protected and fulﬁlled.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

A child’s brain develops rapidly during the ﬁrst ﬁve years of life, especially
the ﬁrst three years. It is a time of rapid cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional
and motor development. For example, a child learns many words starting
at around 15–18 months. Rapid language learning continues into the
preschool years.
The child’s brain grows as she or he sees, feels, tastes, smells and hears.
Each time the child uses one of the senses, a neural connection is made in
the child’s brain. New experiences repeated many times help make new
connections, which shape the way the child thinks, feels, behaves and learns
now and in the future.
A close relationship between the child and the caregiver is the best way to
nourish the child’s growing brain. When a caregiver plays with and sings,
speaks, reads or tells a story to the child and nurtures her or him with healthy
food, love and affection, the child’s brain grows. Being healthy, interacting
with caregivers and living in a safe and clean environment can make a big
difference in a child’s growth, development and future potential.
Babies need lots of care and affection in the early years. Holding, cuddling
and talking to the child stimulate brain growth and promote emotional
development. Being kept close to the mother and breastfed on demand

both nutrition and comfort.
For young children, crying is a way of communicating. Responding to
the child’s cry by holding and/or talking soothingly to her or him will help
establish a sense of trust and security.
This kind of early bonding and attachment to the mother, father or other close
caregiver helps a child develop a broad range of abilities to use and build
upon throughout life. These include the ability to:

●

be self-conﬁdent and have high self-esteem

●

have positive social skills

●

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

As children’s brains develop, so do their emotions, which are real and
powerful. Children may become frustrated if they are unable to do something
or have something they want. They are often frightened of strangers,
new situations or the dark. Children whose reactions are laughed at,
punished or ignored may grow up shy and unable to express emotions
normally. If caregivers are patient and sympathetic when a child expresses
strong emotions, the child is more likely to grow up happy, secure and
well balanced.
Boys and girls have the same physical, mental, emotional and social needs.
Both have the same capacity for learning. Both have the same need for
affection, attention and approval.

BREASTFEEDING

Young children can experience excessive stress if they are physically or
emotionally punished, are exposed to violence, are neglected or abused, or
live in families with mental illness, such as depression or substance abuse.
These stresses interfere with the developing brain and can lead to cognitive,
social and emotional delays and behaviour problems in childhood and later
in life.
Children who are physically or mentally punished in anger are more likely
to become violent themselves. More positive and effective ways to address
children’s behaviour can include:
providing a child with clear explanations about what to do and what not
to do

These responses by parents and other caregivers encourage children so they
become well-adjusted and productive members of the family and community.
Both parents, as well as other family members, need to be involved in caring

make both girls and boys feel equally valued as they encourage them to learn
and explore – this is important preparation for school.
Mothers around the world generally take on the primary role of addressing
their children’s rights and needs. They love, feed, console, teach, play with and
care for their children.
A father’s role is as vital as the mother’s in nurturing and caring for their
children and protecting their rights. A father should make daughters and
sons feel they are equally important. Just like the mother, the father can help
meet their child’s needs for love, affection, approval, encouragement and
stimulation. Together, the mother and father can ensure that the child receives
a quality education and good nutrition and health care.

Affection, attention and stimulation
Children’s minds develop rapidly when they are talked to, touched and
cuddled; when they see and hear familiar faces and voices; and when they
handle different objects.
Children learn quickly when they feel loved and secure from birth and when
they play and interact with family members and other people close to them.
The more often mothers, fathers and other caregivers play with, talk to and
respond to the child, the faster she or he learns.
Parents and other caregivers should consistently talk, read and sing to infants
and young children. Even if the child is not yet able to understand the words,
these early ‘conversations’ help to develop social and language skills and
learning capacities.

34 Facts for Life

Parents and other caregivers can help children learn and grow by giving them
new, interesting and safe things to look at, listen to, smell, hold and play with.
Children who feel secure and loved usually do better in school, are more
self-conﬁdent, have good self-esteem and are able to cope more easily with
life’s challenges.
Good nutrition

While the mother has the primary role of breastfeeding the child, the father
can support her by making sure she has nutritious food, helping with
household and childcare responsibilities, and being emotionally supportive of
her, the baby, the older children and other family members.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Good nutrition is vital for a child’s growth and development. The diet of a
pregnant woman and that of a young child should be varied and nutritious. It
should include essential nutrients such as proteins and essential fats to help
a child’s body grow and have energy, vitamin A to help a child resist illness,
iodine to help ensure the healthy development of a child’s brain, and iron to
protect a child’s mental and physical abilities.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Exclusive breastfeeding on demand for the ﬁrst six months, timely
introduction of safe and nutritious foods at the age of 6 months and
continued breastfeeding for two years or beyond provide the child with
optimal nutrition and health beneﬁts. Feeding time is also an opportunity
for the child to receive affection and have contact with the mother, father or

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Children play because it is fun. Play is also key to their learning and
development. Playing, both structured and unstructured, lays the foundation
for a child’s development of future learning and life skills. It helps children:
●

develop their knowledge, experience, curiosity and conﬁdence

●

learn by trying things, comparing results, asking questions and meeting
challenges

●

develop the skills of language, thinking, planning, organizing and
decision-making.

Stimulation, play and being included in play with other children and adults
are very important for children with disabilities or chronic illnesses, such as
children with HIV.
When parents and other caregivers talk and interact with children in their
ﬁrst language, it helps children develop the ability to think and express
themselves. Children learn language quickly and easily through hearing and
singing songs, having stories told or read to them, repeating rhymes and
playing games.
Girls and boys need the same opportunities for play and interaction with
all family members, including siblings and grandparents, and in activities

outside the home. Play and interaction with the mother and the father help
strengthen the bond between the child and both parents.
Family members and other caregivers can help children learn by giving
them simple tasks with clear instructions, providing objects to play with and
suggesting new activities. They should not dominate the child’s play.

Parents and caregivers need to be patient when a very young child insists
on trying to do something without help. Children learn by trying until they
succeed. As long as the child is protected from danger, struggling to do
something new and difﬁcult is a positive step in the child’s development.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

All children need a variety of simple play materials that are suitable for their
stage of development and learning. Water, sand, cardboard boxes, wooden
building blocks, and pots and lids are just as good for facilitating a child’s play
and learning as toys bought from a shop.

Children are constantly changing and developing new abilities. Caregivers
should notice these changes and follow the child’s lead. Responding to and
encouraging children helps them develop more quickly.

adults shout, behave violently, exclude or discriminate, children will learn this
type of behaviour. If adults treat others with kindness, respect and patience,
children will follow their example. If mothers and fathers treat each other with
love and respect, this is what their children will learn and most likely ‘replay’
in their adult relationships.

BREASTFEEDING

By watching and imitating others, young children learn how to interact
socially. They learn acceptable and unacceptable kinds of behaviour.

Children like to pretend. This should be encouraged, as it develops their
imagination and creativity. It also helps the child understand different ways
people behave.

Entering primary school on time is critical to ensure the continuity of a child’s
development. Support from parents, other caregivers, teachers and the
community is very important.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

In most countries, children start primary school at around 6 or 7 years of age.
Starting school is a critical stage in a child’s development.
Both girls and boys should start school at the appropriate age (in accordance
with their country’s policy). By the time they enter school, they should
have basic cognitive and language skills and sufﬁcient social competency
and emotional development to allow them to enjoy learning in the formal
school setting.
The support of parents and other caregivers is very important for children’s
successful transition to school. Parents and other caregivers should equally
and fully support both girls and boys in attending school regularly and
being well prepared. They should also be involved in school activities. This
helps children adapt to the school setting, settle more quickly into the school
learning environment and attend school regularly.
Teachers should be prepared to support young children who are still
developing their basic potential for learning. Teachers have a key role in
building the conﬁdence of both girls and boys so that they can equally enjoy
and succeed at learning. Play continues to be a basic medium of teaching and
learning in the early school years. A child-friendly school that supports active
learning and promotes participation offers the best learning environment
for children.
Along with families and the school, the community – both local authorities
and civil society – can contribute to:
●

making school a priority within the community

●

making sure the school is a safe and welcoming place for all children

●

making sure the school has the resources it needs, including community
members involved in school management and parent-teacher
associations.

All children grow and develop in similar patterns, but each child develops at
her or his own pace. Every child has her or his own interests, temperament,
style of social interaction and approach to learning.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

By observing how young children respond to touch, sound and sight, parents
can identify signs of possible developmental problems or disabilities. If a
young child is developing slowly, parents and other caregivers can help by
spending extra time with the child, playing and talking with the child, and
massaging the child’s body.

A girl or boy with a disability needs lots of love and extra protection. She
or he needs all the same attention, care and support every other child
needs: birth registration, breastfeeding, immunizations, nutritious food, and
protection from abuse and violence. Like all children, children with disabilities
should be encouraged to play and interact with other children.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

If the child does not respond to attention and stimulation, parents and other
caregivers need to seek help from a trained health worker. Taking early
action is very important in helping children who have delays and disabilities
reach their full potential. Parents and other caregivers need to encourage the
greatest possible development of the child’s abilities.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Understanding the ages and stages of child development helps parents
understand the changes to expect as a child grows and develops (refer to the
the following chart). Parents or other caregivers should be able to seek help
when they feel their child is not developing as expected.

A child who is unhappy or experiencing emotional difﬁculties may exhibit
unusual behaviour. Examples include:

●

consistently acting out or misbehaving

●

crying often

●

having sleep difﬁculties

●

becoming violent with other children

●

sitting alone instead of playing with family or friends

●

suddenly having no interest in usual activities or schoolwork

●

losing appetite.

The child’s parents or other caregivers should be encouraged to talk with
and listen to the child. If the problem persists, they should seek help from a
trained health worker or teacher.
If a child has mental or emotional difﬁculties or has been abused, she or he
needs mental health or counselling services. The child should be assessed to
determine what support and treatment are needed.

The following chart gives parents an idea of how young children develop. Each stage of
development is part of a continuum, building on the previous stage and affecting the next.
Not all children grow and develop at the same pace. Slow progress may be normal or may
be due to inadequate nutrition, poor health, lack of stimulation or a more serious problem.
Parents may wish to discuss their child’s progress with a trained health worker or a teacher.

abies who are breastfed are generally
healthier and achieve optimal growth and
development compared to those who are fed
formula milk.

B

Infants who are not breastfed are at an increased risk of illness that can compromise their
growth and raise the risk of death or disability. Breastfed babies receive protection from
illnesses through the mother’s milk.

If a mother is HIV-positive, there is a risk that she can transmit HIV to her baby through
breastfeeding. Counselling can help her carefully weigh the risks and make an informed
decision on which feeding option is best for her baby and most manageable for her.
Almost every mother can breastfeed successfully. All mothers, particularly those who might
lack the conﬁdence to breastfeed, need the encouragement and practical support of the
baby’s father and their families, friends and relatives. Health workers, community workers,
women’s organizations and employers can also provide support.

BREASTFEEDING

Everyone has the right to information about the beneﬁts of breastfeeding and the risks
of artiﬁcial feeding. Governments have a responsibility to provide this information.
Communities as well as media and other channels of communication can play a key role in
promoting breastfeeding.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Breastfeeding is the natural and recommended way of feeding all infants, even when
artiﬁcial feeding is affordable, clean water is available, and good hygienic conditions for
preparing and feeding infant formula exist.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

If the vast majority of babies were exclusively fed
breastmilk in their ﬁrst six months of life – meaning
only breastmilk and no other liquids or solids, not
even water – it is estimated that the lives of at least
1.2 million children would be saved every year. If
children continue to be breastfed up to two years
and beyond, the health and development of
millions of children would be greatly improved.

breastmilk alone for the ﬁrst six months, unless it is acceptable, feasible,
affordable, sustainable and safe to give breastmilk substitutes (infant
formula) exclusively.

KEY MESSAGE

1.

Breastmilk alone is the best food and drink for an infant for the ﬁrst six
months of life. No other food or drink, not even water, is usually needed
during this period.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Breastmilk is the best food a young child can have. It promotes optimal
growth and development and protects against illness. Breastmilk contains the
perfect balance of nutrients for a baby, unlike infant formula, powdered milk
or animal milk.
The baby does not need water or other drinks or foods (such as tea, juice,
sugar water, gripe water, rice water, other milks, formula or porridge) during
the ﬁrst six months. Even in hot, dry climates, breastmilk fully meets a baby’s
need for ﬂuids.
Breastmilk is easy for the baby to digest. A baby has difﬁculty digesting
animal milks, and formula is digested much more slowly than breastmilk.
Compared to other options, breastmilk nourishes the baby more efﬁciently.
Breastmilk protects against illness because it contains antibodies that transfer
the mother’s immunity or resistance to disease to the child. No other milks
contain these antibodies.
Giving a baby under 6 months of age any liquids or foods other than
breastmilk increases the risk of diarrhoea and other illnesses. Water and other
liquids or foods may be contaminated, which can cause diarrhoea.

50 Facts for Life

A baby who takes water or other liquids or foods in the ﬁrst six months
suckles less on the breast. This slows down breastmilk production.
If regular weighing shows that a breastfed baby under 6 months of age is not
growing well:

●

The baby may need more opportunities to breastfeed. The baby should
breastfeed on demand, day and night, at least eight times during a
24-hour period. The baby should be allowed to breastfeed until she or he
releases the breast and looks satisﬁed and sleepy. This shows that the
baby has had all she or he wants from that breast. The baby should then
be offered the other breast and may or may not want it. The baby should
be kept on the breast until she or he has ﬁnished suckling.

●

A low-birthweight baby may need frequent pauses during breastfeeding.

●

The baby may be ill and should be checked by a trained health worker.

●

The baby may be getting water or other ﬂuids, which can reduce the
intake of breastmilk. The mother may need guidance on how to reduce
and eliminate other ﬂuids and to increase and give only breastmilk.

Feeding a baby only with breastmilk and on demand during the ﬁrst six
months can help to delay the return of the mother’s menstruation. T his may
help to delay the next pregnancy. However, there is some possibility – less
than 2 per cent – that a mother can become pregnant before her periods
return. This becomes increasingly likely after six months.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

The mother may need help to improve the way the baby takes the
breast into the mouth to ensure good attachment so the baby can suckle
effectively.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

BREASTFEEDING

2.

Skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding soon after birth stimulate production
of the mother’s breastmilk. Breastfeeding also helps the mother’s womb
contract, which reduces the risk of heavy bleeding or infection and helps to
expel the placenta (afterbirth).

Supporting Information 51

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Colostrum, the thick yellowish milk the mother produces in the ﬁrst few
days after giving birth, is the perfect food for newborn babies. It is very
nutritious and full of antibodies that help protect the baby against infections.
Sometimes mothers are advised not to feed colostrum to their babies. This
advice is incorrect. Newborns beneﬁt from colostrum.

The newborn needs no other food or drink while the mother’s milk supply is
coming in and breastfeeding is being fully established. Giving any other food
or drink may slow the production of milk. It can also increase the chance of
diarrhoea and other infections. The milk produced by the mother is nutritious
and the right amount for the newborn. The baby should breastfeed as often as
she or he wants.
A baby who has problems suckling in the ﬁrst few days should be kept
close to the mother, offered the breast frequently, helped to take the breast
and given breastmilk expressed directly into the mouth or fed expressed
breastmilk from a clean cup (not from a bottle). The mother should receive
help to improve the baby’s attachment and suckling, and should also be
shown how to express breastmilk, if necessary.
A mother’s own milk is best for low-birthweight babies. However, not all
of these infants are able to feed from the breast in the ﬁrst days of life. For
them, other options are available. In order of preference, they are: expressed
breastmilk (from the mother); donor breastmilk (only if the donor is HIV-tested
and the milk is correctly heat-treated); and infant formula. All of these should
be given by cup, spoon or paladai (a cup feeding device), or medical tubes
used by a trained health worker in a health facility.
Heat-treated breastmilk involves heating expressed breastmilk (enough for
one or two feeds) in a small pan or in a metal container standing in a pan of
water until it comes to a boil. The milk is then left to cool in a clean, covered
container before it is fed to the baby by cup. A trained health worker can
provide further guidance on expressing and heat-treating breastmilk.
It is best for the mother and her baby to stay together in the same room
immediately after birth. If a mother gives birth in a hospital or clinic, she is
entitled to have her baby near her, 24 hours a day. She should insist that no
formula or water be given to her baby if she is breastfeeding.

Almost every mother can breastfeed successfully. Breastfeeding the baby

least eight times daily, day and night, and on demand.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

A mother’s breasts make as much milk as the baby wants. If the baby
suckles more, more milk is produced. Almost every mother can successfully
breastfeed and produce enough milk when:
●

she breastfeeds exclusively

●

the baby is in a good position and is well attached to the breast, with the
breast well in the baby’s mouth

52 Facts for Life

●

the baby feeds as often and for as long as she or he wants, including
during the night, and is kept on the breast until she or he has ﬁnished
suckling. The baby should ﬁnish feeding from one breast before being fed
from the other breast.

Holding the baby in a good position makes it easier for the baby to take the
breast well into the mouth and suckle.
Signs that the baby is in a good position for breastfeeding are:
the baby’s head and body are in line

●

the baby is close to the mother’s body

●

the baby’s whole body is turned towards the mother

●

the baby is relaxed, happy and suckling.

Holding the baby in a poor position can cause difﬁculties such as:
sore and cracked nipples

●

the baby does not receive enough milk

●

the baby refuses to feed.

Signs that the baby is well attached:
●

more of the dark skin around the mother’s nipple (areola) can be seen
above the baby’s mouth than below it

●

the baby’s mouth is wide open

●

the baby’s lower lip is turned outward

●

the baby’s chin is touching the mother’s breast.

From birth, the baby should breastfeed whenever she or he wants. A baby
should be fed on demand at least eight times in a 24-hour period, during
both the day and the night. If a newborn sleeps more than three hours after
breastfeeding, she or he may be gently awakened and offered the breast.

to suckle the breast for comfort. More suckling produces more breastmilk,
which helps satisfy the baby’s feeding needs. If the baby cries a lot and does
not settle after feeding and being cuddled, the mother may need additional
breastfeeding support or the baby might not be well. A trained health worker
should be consulted.
Using paciﬁers, dummies or bottles can interfere with establishing
breastfeeding in the baby’s ﬁrst months of life, as the sucking action for these
is different from suckling at the breast. The baby may become used to the
bottle teat or paciﬁer and refuse the breast. This may cause less suckling time
at the breast, which reduces milk production. Paciﬁers and bottle teats may
become contaminated, increasing a baby’s risk of illness.
Mothers who fear they do not have enough breastmilk often give their babies
other food or drink in the ﬁrst few months of life. This causes the baby to
suckle less often, so less breastmilk is produced. The mother will produce
more milk if she does not give the child other food or liquids and if she
breastfeeds often.
Mothers need to be reassured that they can feed their babies under 6 months
of age properly with breastmilk alone, and they need to be shown how to
do it. All mothers, especially those lacking the conﬁdence to breastfeed,
need encouragement and support from the child’s father and their families,
neighbours, friends, health workers, employers and women’s organizations.
A mother who has undergone a Caesarean birth may require extra help to
begin breastfeeding her baby.
Skilled birth attendants can raise awareness and understanding about
the beneﬁts of breastfeeding. They should support mothers to initiate and
continue breastfeeding and help fathers and other family members accept
breastfeeding as a natural and nutritious practice that protects the life of
the baby.

is greatest when breastmilk alone is given for the ﬁrst six months and when
breastfeeding continues along with other foods well into the second year and
beyond. No other milks, foods or supplements can provide the protection
of breastmilk.

54 Facts for Life

Breastfeeding helps a mother and baby form a close, loving relationship –
a process called bonding. The close contact and attention help infants feel
secure and loved, which is important for their growth and development.
The father and other family members can help by encouraging the mother
to rest quietly while she breastfeeds the baby. They can also make sure the
mother has enough nutritious food and help with household tasks and caring
for older children.
KEY MESSAGE

Bottle feeding and giving a baby breastmilk substitutes such as infant
formula or animal milk can threaten the baby’s health and survival. If
a woman cannot breastfeed her infant, the baby can be fed expressed
breastmilk or, if necessary, a quality breastmilk substitute from an ordinary
clean cup.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Feeding the baby breastmilk substitutes can cause poor growth or illness if
(1) too much or too little water is added, (2) the water is not from a safe
source and/or (3) the bottles and teats are not cleaned properly. Powdered
breastmilk substitutes may contain harmful bacteria that can cause illness.
Studies suggest that children fed breastmilk substitutes, as compared to
breastfed children, are at greater risk of childhood obesity and some chronic
illnesses, such as heart disease, later in life.

Supporting Information 55

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

If it is necessary to feed the baby with formula, it is important to boil clean
drinking water ﬁrst and then add the hot water to the powdered formula. The
water should not be added after it has cooled down. The directions for mixing
should be carefully followed. This ensures that the right amounts of formula
and safe water are mixed and that the process is hygienic. Before giving the
formula to the baby, the mother, father or other caregiver must make sure it
is not too hot.

BREASTFEEDING

Feeding the baby breastmilk substitutes can be expensive and particularly
risky if parents cannot afford to buy enough of a quality breastmilk substitute.
For example, to feed one baby for the ﬁrst six months requires 20 kilograms
(about 40 tins) of infant formula. Trained health workers should inform all
parents considering the use of breastmilk substitutes about the costs.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Babies who do not receive breastmilk do not receive protection from illnesses
provided by the mother’s antibodies and other components that come in her
milk. These babies are more likely to get diarrhoea and respiratory and ear
infections. Diarrhoea and respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, can be
deadly in babies and young children.

Animal milk and infant formula go bad if left at room temperature (around
20–25 degrees Celsius) for more than two hours. Breastmilk can be stored
for up to eight hours at room temperature without going bad. Of course, it is
better to safely store all types of milk in a clean, covered container, preferably
in a refrigerator.
Cup feeding is safer than bottle feeding because the cup can be easily cleaned
with soap and water. Cup feeding also provides some of the contact and
stimulation the baby needs, since the person has to hold the baby. Feeding
with a cup does not cause problems with suckling at the breast.
The best food for a baby who cannot be breastfed directly is milk expressed
from the mother’s breast, given from a clean, open cup. Even newborn
babies can be fed with an open cup. If it is necessary to feed a baby with
a nutritionally adequate breastmilk substitute, it should be fed to the baby
by cup.

If a woman is infected with HIV, there is a risk that she can pass the infection
to her infant through breastfeeding. In the ﬁrst six months, this risk is much
greater if the infant is fed both breastmilk and other liquids and foods than
if fed breastmilk alone. Therefore, it is recommended that the baby receives
breastmilk alone for the ﬁrst six months, unless it is acceptable, feasible,
affordable, sustainable and safe to give breastmilk substitutes (infant
formula) exclusively.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

HIV testing, treatment and counselling
Pregnant women and new mothers who think they may be infected with
HIV should consult a trained health worker for HIV testing and counselling.
Women who are HIV-positive should be counselled on how to reduce the risk
of passing HIV to their children during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
They should also be counselled and supported on how to get treatment and
care for themselves.
A trained health worker can provide women who are HIV-positive with
information on antiretroviral therapy (ART), a group of medicines for
people with HIV infection. ART can help reduce the risk of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV and contribute to keeping the mother healthy.
All health workers should know if HIV testing and ART are available at their
local clinic. They should provide information on these and other related
services to pregnant women and new mothers.

56 Facts for Life

Assess the risks and determine what is manageable
The HIV-positive mother should be counselled and provided with information
to help her decide which feeding option is best for her baby and most
manageable for her. The HIV-positive mother should know that:
if she breastfeeds exclusively during the ﬁrst six months she reduces the
baby’s risk of illness, malnutrition and death

●

if she uses breastmilk substitutes such as infant formula exclusively she
avoids the risk of HIV infection through breastmilk

●

shortening the duration of breastfeeding can reduce the risk of
transmitting the infection to the infant.

The most appropriate infant feeding option for the child of an HIV-infected
mother ultimately depends on individual circumstances. The mother needs to
assess the risks through discussion with a trained health worker. The mother
infected with HIV has the right to (1) the information she needs to make an
informed decision and (2) all the services and support necessary to help her
implement that decision.

The ﬁrst six months:
Feeding the baby with infant formula (breastmilk substitutes) should be
considered only if it is acceptable, affordable, feasible, sustainable and
safe for the mother and child. If all these conditions can be met, the baby
can be fed a quality breastmilk substitute alone for the ﬁrst six months,
with no breastmilk or other foods. This eliminates the risk of passing HIV
to the baby through breastfeeding.

●

If the HIV-positive mother decides to breastfeed, she should feed her baby
breastmilk exclusively, giving no other liquids, milks or foods, for the ﬁrst
six months. Feeding breastmilk alone in the ﬁrst six months can reduce a
baby’s risk of HIV infection compared to giving both breastmilk and other
foods and liquids (‘mixed feeding’).

●

Mixed feeding not only greatly increases the risk of transmitting HIV
to the baby in the ﬁrst six months but also causes more illness, such
as diarrhoea and pneumonia, and malnutrition, and increases the risk
of death.

and safe diet can be provided, all breastfeeding should stop.
Other Important Information
During counselling, a pregnant woman or new mother with HIV can be helped
to determine whether she can provide her baby with a nutritionally adequate
and safe diet without breastmilk. This assessment should be undertaken not
only once, such as before the child is born, but also throughout the period of
breastfeeding, with the support of the trained health worker.
If the mother is conﬁdent that she can provide sufﬁcient amounts of a quality
breastmilk substitute, properly and hygienically prepared with clean water,
then she can opt to stop all breastfeeding and begin using the breastmilk
substitute. A trained health worker should provide the mother and father with
guidance on safe and clean practices to prepare the breastmilk substitute.
A new mother who does not know her HIV status should exclusively
breastfeed her child for the ﬁrst six months and continue breastfeeding for
up to two years and beyond in addition to feeding the child other nutritious
foods and drinks.
Infants conﬁrmed as HIV-positive should be breastfed so they can receive the
beneﬁts of breastmilk.
(Refer to the HIV chapter for more information on children and families living
with HIV.)

7.

A woman employed away from her home can continue to breastfeed her
child. She should breastfeed as often as possible when she is with the infant
and express her breastmilk when they are apart so that another caregiver can
feed it to the baby in a clean and safe way.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

If a mother cannot be with her baby during working hours, she should
breastfeed often when they are together. With frequent breastfeeding, she will
continue to produce breastmilk.
If a woman cannot breastfeed at her workplace, she can express her milk
two or three times during the workday and refrigerate it or store it at room
temperature for up to eight hours in a clean, covered container. The expressed
milk can be given to the child by another caregiver from a clean cup.
Families and communities can encourage employers to provide paid
maternity leave, crèches, and the time and a suitable place for women to

8.

After 6 months of age, when babies begin to eat foods, breastfeeding should
continue for up to two years and beyond because it is an important source of
nutrition, energy and protection from illness.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

It is recommended that a mother continue to breastfeed her child up to
two years and beyond – as long as she and the child wish to continue.
Breastfeeding can comfort a child who is upset and is an important source of
nourishment during a child’s illness.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Breastmilk remains an important source of energy, protein and other
nutrients such as vitamin A and iron, even when babies begin to consume
additional foods after 6 months of age. Breastmilk helps protect a child
against disease for as long as the child breastfeeds.

ore than one third of all child deaths
every year around the world are
attributed to malnutrition, speciﬁcally
undernutrition, which weakens the body’s
resistance to illness.

M

Malnutrition develops when the body does not get
the proper amount of energy (calories), proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals and
other nutrients required to keep the organs and tissues healthy and functioning well. A child
or adult can be malnourished by being undernourished or overnourished.

When a household does not have enough food and has conditions that make diarrhoea and
other illnesses common, children are the most vulnerable to becoming malnourished. When
children become sick, they lose energy and nutrients quickly, which puts their lives at risk
faster than adults.

Children with chronic diseases, such as HIV, are even more susceptible to malnutrition.
Their bodies have a harder time absorbing vitamins, iron and other nutrients. Children with
disabilities may need extra attention to make sure they get the nutrition they need.

BREASTFEEDING

Overnutrition is when a person is overweight or obese. It can cause diabetes in childhood
and cardiovascular disease and other diseases in adulthood. Sometimes children eat large
quantities of foods that are high in energy but not rich in other necessary nutrients, such as
sugary drinks or fried, starchy foods. In such cases improving the quality of the child’s diet is
crucial along with increasing his or her level of physical activity.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

In most parts of the world malnutrition occurs when people are undernourished. Primary
reasons for undernourishment, especially of children and women, are poverty, lack of
food, repeated illnesses, inappropriate feeding practices, lack of care and poor hygiene.
Undernourishment raises the risk of malnutrition. The risk is greatest in the ﬁrst two years
of life. The risk further increases when diarrhoea and other illnesses sap the body of the
proteins, minerals and nutrients required to stay healthy.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

If a woman is malnourished during pregnancy
or if her child is malnourished during the ﬁrst
two years of life, the child’s physical and mental
growth and development will be slowed. This
cannot be corrected when the child is older – it will
affect the child for the rest of his or her life.

All girls and boys have the right to a caring and protective environment, with mothers,
fathers or other caregivers making sure they are well nourished with a healthy diet.

A young child should grow and gain weight rapidly. From birth to age 2,
children should be weighed regularly to assess growth. If regular weighing
shows that the child is not gaining weight, or the parents or other
caregivers see the child is not growing, something is wrong. The child
needs to be seen by a trained health worker.

Breastmilk alone is the only food and drink an infant needs in the ﬁrst six
months of life. After six months, a baby needs a variety of other foods in
addition to breastmilk to ensure healthy growth and development.

3.

From the age of 6–8 months a child needs to eat two to three times per
day and three to four times per day starting at 9 months – in addition to
breastfeeding. Depending on the child’s appetite, one or two nutritious
snacks, such as fruit or bread with nut paste, may be needed between
meals. The baby should be fed small amounts of food that steadily
increase in variety and quantity as he or she grows.

4.

Feeding times are periods of learning, love and interaction, which promote
physical, social and emotional growth and development. The parent or

Children need vitamin A to help resist illness, protect their eyesight
and reduce the risk of death. Vitamin A can be found in many fruits and
vegetables, red palm oil, eggs, dairy products, liver, ﬁsh, meat, fortiﬁed
foods and breastmilk. In areas where vitamin A deﬁciency is common,
high-dose vitamin A supplements can also be given every four to six
months to children aged 6 months to 5 years.

As the child’s intake of foods and drinks increases, the risk of diarrhoea
substantially increases. Contamination of foods with germs is a major

shows that the child is not gaining weight, or the parents or other
caregivers see the child is not growing, something is wrong. The child

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Weight gain is the most important sign that a child is healthy and is growing
and developing well. From birth to 1 year of age, infants should be weighed
at least once every month. From 1–2 years of age they should be weighed at
least once every three months.
Whenever a child visits a health centre, he or she should be weighed. This can
help early detection of faltering growth so appropriate actions can be taken.
A health check-up can also detect if a child is gaining weight too fast for his
or her age. This requires examining a child’s weight in relation to his or her
height, which can determine if the child is overweight.
If the child is underweight or overweight, it is important to examine the child’s
diet and provide the parents or other caregiver with advice on good nutrition.
Increasingly there are undernourished and overnourished people side by side
in a family.
A child who is given only breastmilk for the ﬁrst six months usually grows
well during this time. Breastfeeding helps protect babies from common
illnesses and ensures good physical and mental growth and development.
Infants who are breastfed tend to learn more readily than infants who are
fed other kinds of milk.
64 Facts for Life

From the age of 6 months, a child needs to start eating a variety of other
nutritious foods, in addition to breastmilk, to ensure healthy growth
and development.
Every child should have a growth chart that tracks his or her growth. It
shows whether the child is growing appropriately for his or her age. At each
weighing the child’s weight should be marked with a dot on the growth chart
and the dots should be connected. This will produce a line that shows how
well the child is growing. If the line goes up, the child is doing well. A line that
stays ﬂat or goes down is a cause for concern.

Here are some important questions to ask to help identify growth problems:

●

Is the child receiving enough food? A child aged 6–8 months needs to
receive initially 2–3 spoonfuls of food, increasing gradually to 1⁄2 cup
(250-millilitre), at each meal. A child 9–12 months old needs to receive 1⁄2
cup at each meal. A child 12–23 months old requires 3⁄4 to 1 whole cup of
‘family foods’ at each meal. Children 2 years and older need to receive
at least 1 whole cup at each meal. If the child ﬁnishes his or her food and
wants more, the child needs to be offered more.

●

Do the child’s meals have too little ‘growth’ or ‘energy’ foods? Foods
that help children grow are beans, nuts, meat, ﬁsh, eggs, dairy products,
grains and pulses. The daily inclusion of animal-source foods in the diet is
particularly important. A small amount of oil can add energy. Red palm oil
or other vitamin-enriched edible oils are good sources of energy.

Supporting Information 65

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Is the child eating often enough? In addition to breastfeeding, a child aged
6 – 8 months needs to eat two to three times per day and three to four
times per day starting at 9 months. Additional nutritious snacks, such as
a piece of fruit or bread with nut paste, may be needed one or two times
per day. A child with developmental delays or disabilities may require
extra help and time for feeding.

BREASTFEEDING

●

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

A child who is not gaining enough weight over one or two months may
need larger servings, more nutritious food or more frequent meals. The child
may be sick or may need more attention and care or assistance with eating.
Parents and trained health workers need to act quickly to discover the cause of
the problem and take steps to correct it.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Children need to gain not only adequate weight but also adequate height.
A child’s height can also be tracked on a chart. Good nutrition, care and
hygiene, especially in the ﬁrst two years of life, are necessary to prevent
children from becoming too short for their age (stunted). If a mother is
undernourished or does not have proper nutrition during pregnancy, her child
may be born too small. This puts the child at risk of becoming stunted later
on. A low-birthweight baby needs additional attention to feeding and care to
grow adequately.

High-quality ‘growth’ foods are especially important to ensure that
children gain both adequate weight and height. Foods such as highly
processed fatty foods or sugary snacks are not rich in vitamins and
minerals and other important nutrients and may cause children to gain
too much weight without a proportionate growth in height.
●

Is the child refusing to eat? If the child does not seem to like the taste of
a particular food, other foods should be offered. New foods should be
introduced gradually.

●

Is the child sick? A sick child needs encouragement to eat small, frequent
meals. The child needs to be breastfed more frequently. After an illness,
the child needs to eat more than usual to regain the weight lost and to
replenish energy and nourishment. If the child is frequently ill, he or she
should be checked by a trained health worker.

●

Is the child getting enough foods with vitamin A? Breastmilk is rich in
vitamin A. Other foods with vitamin A are liver, eggs, dairy products,
red palm oil, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, and green leafy
vegetables. If these foods are not available in adequate amounts, a healthcare provider can provide the child with a vitamin A supplement (tablet or
syrup) every four to six months.

●

Is the child being given breastmilk substitutes by bottle? If a breastmilk
substitute is given, it should be fed from a clean, open cup, rather than
from a bottle.

●

Is the food kept clean? If not, the child will often be ill. Raw food should
be washed or cooked with clean water from a safe source. Cooked food
should be eaten without delay. Leftover food should be carefully stored
and thoroughly reheated.

●

Is the water kept clean? Clean water is vital for a child’s health. Water
should come from a safe source and be kept clean by storing it in covered
containers that are clean on the inside and outside. Clean drinking water
can be obtained from a regularly maintained, controlled and chlorinated
piped supply, public standpipe, borehole, protected dug well, protected
spring or rainwater collection. If water is drawn from ponds, streams,
unprotected springs, wells or tanks, it needs to be puriﬁed. Home water
treatments can be used such as boiling, ﬁltering, adding chlorine or
disinfecting with sunlight in accordance with information provided by a
trained health worker or extension agent.

●

Are faeces being put in a latrine or toilet or buried? Are hands being
washed with soap and water or a substitute, such as ash and water, after
use of the latrine or toilet? If not, the child may frequently get worms and
other sicknesses. A child with worms needs deworming medicine from a
trained health worker.

●

Is the young child left alone much of the time or in the care of an older
child? If so, the young child may need more attention and interaction from
adults, especially during mealtime.

KEY MESSAGE

2.

Breastmilk alone is the only food and drink an infant needs in the ﬁrst six
months of life. After six months, a baby needs a variety of other foods in
addition to breastmilk to ensure healthy growth and development.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

In the ﬁrst six months, when a baby is most at risk, exclusive breastfeeding
helps to protect against diarrhoea and other common infections and gets the
baby off to a good start in life.

A variety of foods – vegetables and fruits, meat, poultry, ﬁsh, eggs and dairy
products – help to meet the child’s nutrition needs. Breastfeeding for up to
two years and beyond provides an important source of nutrients that protect
against disease.

When introducing solid foods, it is important to start with soft, mushy foods
and move gradually to more solid foods. The greater the variety of healthy
foods, the more balanced and nutritious the child’s diet.

Parents or other caregivers should avoid giving foods that may cause choking,
such as nuts, grapes and raw carrots and other foods that have a shape and/or
consistency that may cause them to become lodged in the child’s throat.

Supporting Information 67

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

It may be difﬁcult to meet all the child’s nutrient requirements without a lot of
foods from animal sources. So it may be necessary to give the child fortiﬁed
foods or spreads or multiple vitamin and mineral supplements, such as
powders, syrups or dissolvable tablets. A trained health worker can advise
the parent or other caregiver about foods that provide the most nutrients and
which supplements to use.

BREASTFEEDING

The consistency and variety of foods should be adapted to a child’s
requirements and eating abilities. At 6 months of age infants can eat pureed
or mashed foods, thick soups and porridges. By 8 months most infants
can also eat ‘ﬁnger foods’ (snacks that children can eat by themselves). By
12 months, most children can eat the same types of foods as the rest of
the family.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

If soft, semi-solid or solid foods are introduced too late, the child may not be
getting the necessary nutrients. This can slow down growth and development.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

At 6 months of age, the child needs other foods and drinks in addition to
breastmilk. These provide energy, protein, vitamins and other nutrients
needed to support growth and development.

Following are some nutritious foods for young children (older than six
months) to eat:
●

Staple foods, including cereals (rice, wheat, maize, millet, quinoa), roots
(cassava, yam, potatoes) and starchy fruits (plantain and breadfruit).

●

High-protein foods, such as red meat, poultry, ﬁsh, liver and eggs (can be
given as often as possible).

●

Dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt, curds and dried milk (which can be
mixed with other foods, such as cooked porridge). These are good choices
in the second six months of a breastfed child’s life. These are better
choices than raw milk, which is harder for the child to digest.

●

Green leafy and orange-coloured vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli,
chard, carrots, pumpkins and sweet potatoes (which provide vitamins).

●

Pulses, such as chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, black-eyed peas, kidney beans
and lima beans (to add variety and provide protein, energy and some
iron).

●

Oils, especially rapeseed oil, soy oil, red palm oil, butter or margarine.

●

Seeds, including groundnut paste, other nut pastes and soaked or
germinated seeds, such as pumpkin, sunﬂower, melon or sesame seeds
(for energy and some vitamins).

It is difﬁcult to provide all the nutrients needed by young children in a
vegetarian diet. This is because foods from animal sources provide key
nutrients, such as iron. A child eating a vegetarian diet needs additional
nutrients in the form of multiple vitamin tablets or powders, fortiﬁed spreads
or nutrient-rich food supplements.
Iron from plant foods is generally not absorbed very well by the body.
However, plant foods such as pulses (white beans, chickpeas, lentils) have
more iron. The iron will be better absorbed if eaten together with foods that
are high in vitamin C, such as oranges and other citrus fruits and juices.

The baby should be fed small amounts of food that steadily increase in

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Good nutrition in the ﬁrst two years of life is crucial. Inadequate nutrition
during this period can slow a child’s physical and mental development for the
rest of his or her life.

68 Facts for Life

In order to grow and stay healthy, young children need a variety of nutritious
foods such as meat, ﬁsh, pulses, grains, eggs, fruits and vegetables, as well
as breastmilk.
A child’s stomach is smaller than an adult’s, so a child cannot eat as much at
one meal. However, children’s energy and body-building needs are great. It is
important that children eat frequently to provide for all their needs.
Foods such as mashed vegetables and chopped meat, eggs or ﬁsh should be
added to the child’s diet as often as possible. A small amount of oil may be
added, preferably vitamin-enriched oil.

Young children may need to be encouraged to eat, and they may need help
in handling food or utensils. A child with a developmental delay or disability
may need extra help eating and drinking.

6–8 months:
Children should breastfeed frequently and receive other foods two to three
times a day. Parents should start with soft or mushy foods (such as porridge)
and gradually increase the consistency (thickness) of food. Animal foods such
as meat, eggs and ﬁsh can be given as early as possible, but they should be
mashed, minced or cut into very small pieces. Start with 2–3 spoonfuls per
feeding, increasing gradually to 1⁄2 of a 250-millilitre cup.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

The following gives information on how often and how much a young child
should be fed:

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

If meals are served in a common dish, younger children may not get enough
food. Giving a young child his or her own plate or bowl makes it easier for
the parent or other caregiver to know what foods and how much the child
has eaten.

9–24 months:
BREASTFEEDING

Children should receive other foods three to four times a day in addition to
breastfeeding. Give infants aged 9–11 months 1⁄2 of a 250-millilitre cup per
feeding. Provide children aged 12–23 months 3⁄4 to 1 whole 250-millilitre cup
per feeding. Give children 2 years and older at least 1 whole 250-millilitre
cup per feeding. Foods from animals, such as meat, ﬁsh and eggs, should be
included as much as possible.
By 12 months:

Supporting Information 69

can still be offered semi-solid foods, which are easier for young children to eat.
Additional nutritious snacks (such as fruit, bread or bread with nut paste)
can be offered once or twice per day, as desired, starting at six months.
If the quality or amount of food per meal is low, or the child is no longer
breastfeeding, give 1–2 cups of milk plus one or two extra meals each day.

KEY MESSAGE

Feeding times are periods of learning, love and interaction, which promote
physical, social and emotional growth and development. The parent or other
caregiver should talk to children during feeding, and treat and feed girls and
boys equally and patiently.

4.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Mealtimes provide the opportunity for mothers and fathers or other
caregivers to interact and talk with children and support their learning. This
helps to stimulate social and emotional development.
It is important to encourage children to eat, but not to force-feed them. Each
child’s needs vary due to differences in breastmilk intake and variability in
growth rate. Infants need to be fed directly. Young children should be assisted
when they are learning to feed themselves.
If a child refuses to eat a variety of foods, the caregiver can experiment with
different food combinations, tastes, textures and methods of encouragement.
The caregiver should minimize distractions during meals if the child loses
interest easily.
Girls and boys require the same amount of attention and time for feeding.
They should receive the same quantity and quality of food and drink. They
both need to be breastfed for the ﬁrst six months and receive an adequate
variety and quantity of foods after six months. It is important for both
mothers and fathers to be informed about child nutrition. Both parents should
take part in feeding their daughters and sons.

Children need vitamin A to help resist illness, protect their eyesight
and reduce the risk of death. Vitamin A can be found in many fruits and
vegetables, red palm oil, eggs, dairy products, liver, ﬁsh, meat, fortiﬁed foods
and breastmilk. In areas where vitamin A deﬁciency is common, high-dose
vitamin A supplements can also be given every four to six months to children
aged 6 months to 5 years.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Until infants are 6 months old, breastmilk is the main source of vitamin A,
provided the mother has enough vitamin A from her diet or supplements.
Children aged 6 months to 5 years can get vitamin A from a variety of
other foods, such as liver, eggs, dairy products, fatty ﬁsh, red palm oil, ripe
mangoes and papayas, oranges, yellow sweet potatoes, dark green leafy
vegetables and carrots.
When children do not have enough vitamin A they are less able to ﬁght
potentially fatal diseases and are at risk of night blindness. A child who has
70 Facts for Life

difﬁculty seeing in the early evening and at night is probably deﬁcient in
vitamin A. The child should be taken to a trained health worker for treatment
with high-dose vitamin A supplements.
In a few countries, vitamin A has been added to cooking oils, sugar, wheat
and ﬂours, milk and dairy products, and other foods. In many countries where
vitamin A deﬁciency is widespread and children often die from illnesses such
as diarrhoea and measles, vitamin A is distributed twice a year to children
6 months to 5 years of age in a high-dose capsule or syrup.

In areas where it is known or suspected that children suffer from vitamin A
deﬁciency, those children with diarrhoea should be given a vitamin A
supplement if they have not received one within the past month, or if they are
not already receiving vitamin A at regular four to six month intervals.

Zinc (tablet or syrup) can also be given for 10–14 days to reduce the severity
and the duration of the diarrhoea as well as protect the child for up to
two months from future diarrhoea episodes. The dosage for children over
6 months of age is 20 milligrams per day, for children under 6 months of age
it is 10 milligrams per day.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Children with measles should receive vitamin A on the day of diagnosis, a
dose on the following day and another dose at least two weeks later.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Diarrhoea and measles deplete vitamin A from the child’s body. A child
with diarrhoea lasting several days or with measles, or who is severely
malnourished, should be treated with high-dose vitamin A supplements
obtained from a trained health worker.

KEY MESSAGE

Children need iron-rich foods to protect their physical and mental abilities
and to prevent anaemia. The best sources of iron are animal sources, such
as liver, lean meats and ﬁsh. Other good sources are iron-fortiﬁed foods and
iron supplements.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Iron is found in animal foods such as liver, lean meats and ﬁsh. It is also in
some vegetarian foods such as pulses. Foods such as wheat and maize ﬂours,
salt, ﬁsh sauce or soy sauce are sometimes fortiﬁed with iron. Iron-rich foods
help prevent anaemia. Consuming them with vitamin C helps the digestive
system to better absorb the iron.
Supporting Information 71

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

A lack of iron in the diet is a common cause of anaemia. Children can also
become anaemic from malaria and hookworm. Iron deﬁciency can impair
physical and mental development in infants and young children. Even mild
iron deﬁciency can impair intellectual development. Anaemia is the most
common nutritional disorder in the world.

BREASTFEEDING

6.

Symptoms of anaemia include paleness of the palms of the hands and
of the tongue and inside the eyelids and lips as well as tiredness and
breathlessness.
●

In children under 2 years of age:
Anaemia may cause problems with coordination and balance, and the
child may appear withdrawn and hesitant. This can limit the child’s ability
to interact and may hinder intellectual development.
The child can beneﬁt from iron-containing vitamin and mineral
preparations, such as supplements and multiple vitamin and mineral
powders. These powders can be easily mixed by the caregiver in homeprepared foods for children older than 6 months.

●

In pregnant women and adolescent girls:
Anaemia increases the severity of haemorrhage and the risk of infection
during childbirth. It is an important cause of maternal mortality. Infants
born to anaemic mothers often suffer from low birthweight and anaemia.
Iron supplements for pregnant women protect both the mothers and their
babies. Adolescent girls who are anaemic will also beneﬁt from a weekly
iron-folic acid supplement to build their iron stores and prepare their
bodies for healthy pregnancies.

Malaria and hookworm can be main causes of anaemia. Taking iron
supplements to treat anaemia while having malaria can worsen the anaemia.
With regard to malaria:
●

Children living in malarial areas should not take iron and folic acid
preparations, including iron-containing powders, unless the malaria has
been diagnosed and treated and they have been screened for anaemia.

●

In general, children living in malarial areas should not be given
preventive doses of iron-containing vitamin and mineral preparations or
supplements unless they are delivered through a fortiﬁed food.

●

Pregnant women, mothers, fathers and other caregivers living in malarial
areas need to ask a trained health worker about using iron supplements
for their children.

●

To help prevent malaria, children, pregnant women, and mothers and
other family members should sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito
nets.

With regard to worms:
●

Children living in areas where worms are highly endemic should be
treated two to three times a year with a recommended deworming
(anthelmintic) medication. Deworming the child regularly helps treat the
anaemia caused by worms and also helps children regain their appetite.
Good hygiene practices prevent worms. Children should not play near the

72 Facts for Life

latrine, should wash their hands often with soap and water or a substitute,
such as ash and water, and should wear shoes or sandals to prevent
worm infestations.
●

Pregnant women living in areas where worms are common should be
treated with a recommended deworming medication.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Goitre, an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland causing a swelling
of the neck, is a sign of iodine missing in the diet. Iodine deﬁciency in early
pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth.
Using iodized salt instead of ordinary salt provides pregnant women and children
with as much iodine as they need. Iodized salt is safe for the whole family and is
the only salt needed for all cooking. Families should be sure to buy only iodized
salt of good quality – properly marked and packaged. Mothers need to make sure
they consume only iodized salt before, during and after pregnancy. Mothers and
fathers need to ensure that the salt consumed by their children is iodized.

8.

As the child’s intake of foods and drinks increases, the risk of diarrhoea
substantially increases. Contamination of foods with germs is a major
cause of diarrhoea and other illnesses that cause children to lose nutrients
and energy needed for growth and development. Good hygiene, safe
water and proper handling, preparation and storing of foods are crucial to
prevent illnesses.

KEY MESSAGE

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Small amounts of iodine are essential for children’s growth and development.
If a woman does not have enough iodine during pregnancy, her child is likely
to be born with a mental disability or possibly a hearing or speech disability.
If the child does not get enough iodine during infancy and childhood, he or
she may have delayed physical, mental or cognitive development. Even mild
deﬁciency can reduce learning ability and lower intelligence.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Iodine in a pregnant woman’s and young child’s diet is especially critical for
the development of the child’s brain. It is essential to help prevent learning
disabilities and delayed development. Using iodized salt instead of ordinary
salt provides pregnant women and their children with as much iodine as
they need.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Supporting Information 73

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

As children grow and become mobile they put everything in their mouths.
They can pick up germs more easily as they explore and discover the world
around them. This makes it very important for parents and other caregivers
to practice good hygiene, such as hand washing with soap. They also need
to handle and prepare food properly, use safe water and keep the living

environment clean. These practices are important to prevent diarrhoea and
other illnesses and to protect a child’s health.
Foods should be served immediately after preparation and leftovers safely
stored. Clean utensils and surfaces should be used to prepare and serve food.
Children should be fed with clean cups and bowls. Bottles and nipples/teats
should be avoided because they are difﬁcult to keep clean.
Five key ways to keep food safe are: keep it clean; separate raw and cooked
foods; cook food thoroughly; keep it at a safe temperature; and wash raw
food materials in safe water.
(Refer to the Hygiene chapter for more information.)

During an illness, children need additional ﬂuids and encouragement to eat
regular meals, and breastfeeding infants need to breastfeed more often. After
an illness, children need to be offered more food than usual to replenish the
energy and nourishment lost due to the illness.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

When children are sick, such as when they have diarrhoea, measles or
pneumonia, their appetite decreases and their body uses food less effectively.
If the child is sick several times a year, his or her growth will slow or stop.
It is very important to encourage a sick child to eat. This can be difﬁcult, as
children who are ill may not be hungry. The parent or other caregiver should
keep offering foods the child likes, a little at a time and as often as possible.
Extra breastfeeding is especially important since it can provide nutrients
required for recovery from infections.
It is essential to encourage a sick child to drink as often as possible.
Dehydration (lack of ﬂuids in the body) is a serious problem for children with
diarrhoea. Drinking plenty of liquids will help prevent dehydration. When a
child has diarrhoea, giving him or her oral rehydration salts (ORS) dissolved
in clean water, along with foods and liquids, can help prevent dehydration.
Giving the child a zinc supplement every day for 10–14 days can reduce the
severity of the diarrhoea. The child is not fully recovered from an illness until
he or she weighs about as much as when the illness began.
A child can die from persistent diarrhoea if it is not treated quickly. If
diarrhoea and poor appetite persist for more than a few days, the mother,
father or other caregiver needs to consult a trained health worker.
(Refer to the Diarrhoea chapter for more information.)

Very thin and/or swollen children need special medical care. They should
be taken to a trained health worker or health facility for assessment
and treatment.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Children with severe acute malnutrition are very thin. They may also have
swollen parts of the body, usually the feet and the legs. A trained health
worker can identify severe acute malnutrition by measuring the child’s weight
and height, using a special band to measure the upper arms or checking for
equal swelling in both legs.

Children with severe acute malnutrition get cold more quickly than other
children, so they must always be kept warm. Skin-to-skin contact with the
mother or other caregiver can help keep a child warm. Both the mother and
child should be covered. The child’s head should also be kept covered.

Supporting Information 75

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Although children with severe acute malnutrition need special nutritional
treatment, breastmilk is still a vital source of nutrients and protection from
disease. In addition to the special treatment (either at home or in a facility),
children who are breastfeeding should continue to breastfeed.

BREASTFEEDING

More intensive treatment is needed for children who are not able to eat RUTF,
have other medical problems or are under 6 months old. These cases should
be referred to a hospital or other facility that can provide 24-hour medical
care, therapeutic milks and breastfeeding support.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Treating a child with severe acute malnutrition effectively needs to be done
by a health-care provider. The treatment depends on how sick the child is.
Most children over 6 months old can be treated with a special ready-touse therapeutic food (RUTF). This is a soft pre-packaged food that contains
all the nutrients needed for the child’s recovery. RUTF is easy for children
to consume directly from the packet and requires no mixing with water or
other foods, making it safe to use anywhere. Parents or other caregivers are
provided with a week’s supply of RUTF, along with information on how to
treat the child. Medications are also provided as part of the treatment. The
child should be taken back to the health-care provider every week to monitor
his or her progress.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

A short period of inadequate nutrition together with illness or infection can
quickly make a child dangerously malnourished. The child needs urgent
treatment with special foods and medicine. He or she should be taken directly
to the nearest health-care provider.

76 Facts for Life

Children who are immunized are protected from
these dangerous diseases, which can often lead to disability or death. All children have
the right to this protection.

Although there has been progress in the past years in immunizing children, in 2008
nearly 24 million children — almost 20% of children born each year — did not get the
routine immunizations scheduled for the ﬁrst year of life.
Parents or other caregivers need to know why immunization is important, the
recommended immunization schedule, and where their children can be immunized.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Every girl and boy needs to be fully immunized. Early protection is critical. The
immunizations in the child’s ﬁrst year and into the second year are especially important.
It is also essential that pregnant women are immunized against tetanus to protect
themselves as well as their newborns.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

These diseases include measles, meningitis
caused by Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type B
(Hib), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping
cough), yellow fever, polio and hepatitis B.
New vaccines against other illnesses, such as
pneumonia and diarrhoea caused by rotavirus,
have been developed and are now more
widely used.

2.

Immunization protects against several dangerous diseases. A child who
is not immunized is more likely to become sick, permanently disabled or
undernourished, and could possibly die.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Immunization protects children against some of the most dangerous diseases
of childhood. All children, including those who are disabled, need to be
vaccinated. A child is immunized by vaccines, which are injected or given
by mouth. The vaccines work by building up the child’s defences against
diseases. Immunization only works if given before the disease strikes.
A child who is not immunized is very likely to get measles, whooping cough
and many other diseases that can kill. Children who survive these diseases
are weakened and may not grow well. They may be permanently disabled.
They may die later from malnutrition and other illnesses.
All children need to be immunized with BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin)
vaccine, which offers partial protection against some forms of tuberculosis
and leprosy.
All children need to be immunized against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis
with DTP vaccine (also known as DPT vaccine). Diphtheria causes infection
of the upper respiratory tract, which in severe cases may lead to breathing
difﬁculties and death. Tetanus causes rigid muscles and painful muscle
spasms and can be deadly. Pertussis, or whooping cough, affects the
respiratory tract and can cause a cough that lasts four to eight weeks. The
disease is very dangerous in infants.
All pregnant women and infants need to be immunized against tetanus.
●

Immunizing a woman or adolescent with at least two doses of tetanus
toxoid before or during pregnancy protects the newborn for the ﬁrst few
weeks of life and protects the mother.

●

At 6 weeks old, a baby needs the ﬁrst dose of tetanus toxoid (the tetanus
component of the DTP (DPT) vaccine) to extend the protection received
from the mother against tetanus.

All children need to be immunized against measles, which can be a major
cause of malnutrition, poor mental development, and hearing and visual
impairments. The signs that a child has measles are a fever and rash, together
with a cough, a runny nose or red eyes. A child can die from measles.

82 Facts for Life

In countries where hepatitis B is a problem, up to 10 out of every 100 children
will harbour the infection for life if they are not immunized with hepatitis B
vaccine. Up to one quarter of children infected with hepatitis B may develop
serious liver conditions such as cancer when they are older.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

In many countries, pneumonia caused by pneumococcus bacteria or
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type B (Hib) bacteria is common and kills many
young children. Either of these bacteria can also cause childhood meningitis
and other serious infections. These bacteria are among the most dangerous
for children, particularly those under 5 years old. Vaccination with
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type B vaccine (Hib vaccine) and pneumococcal
(conjugate) vaccine (PCV) can prevent these deaths.

IMMUNIZATION

All children need to be immunized against polio. The signs of polio are a
ﬂoppy limb or the inability to move. For every 200 children infected, one will
be disabled for life.

A pentavalent vaccine (ﬁve vaccines in one), combining the DTP (DPT),
hepatitis B and Hib vaccines, is increasingly being used by national
immunization programmes.
CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Diarrhoea caused by rotavirus is common and can be severe. It affects
nearly every child under age 5. Severe rotavirus diarrhoea is more common
in developing countries where health care can be more difﬁcult to access,
resulting in many deaths in children under 5 years old, especially children
under 2. Vaccination against rotavirus prevents diarrhoea caused by this virus.
However, diarrhoea due to other bacteria or viruses can still occur in children
who receive the rotavirus vaccine.
In some countries, yellow fever puts the lives of many young children and
adults at risk. Vaccination can prevent the disease.

BREASTFEEDING

Japanese encephalitis virus is spread by mosquitoes, mainly in rural areas
of Asian countries. It causes a severe illness, killing up to one third of those
affected. Many survivors have brain damage. A trained health worker should
be consulted for advice and information on national guidelines regarding use
of this vaccine.
Breastmilk and colostrum, the thick yellow milk produced during the ﬁrst
few days after a woman gives birth, provide protection against diarrhoea,
pneumonia and other diseases. Colostrum is sometimes referred to as a
newborn’s ‘ﬁrst vaccine’, helping to build the child’s immunity to disease.

Supporting Information 83

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

In many countries where vitamin A deﬁciency is common, high-dose
vitamin A capsules (or syrup) are administered to each child aged 6 months
to 5 years, every four to six months. Vitamin A is distributed during routine
immunization (such as with measles vaccine at 9 months) as well as during

special immunization campaigns. Vitamin A is also an important part of
measles treatment.
KEY MESSAGE

It is safe to immunize a child who has a minor illness or a disability or is
malnourished.

3.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Many parents do not take a child to be immunized because the child has a
fever, cough, cold, diarrhoea or some other illness. However, it is safe to
immunize a child who has a minor illness.
It is also safe to immunize a child who has a disability or is malnourished. If a
child is HIV-positive or suspected to be HIV-positive, a trained health worker
should be consulted about which vaccines to give the child.
After an injection, the child may cry or develop a fever, a minor rash or a
small sore. This is normal and shows that the vaccine is working. Children
under 6 months of age should breastfeed frequently; older children should
be given plenty of liquids and foods. If the child develops a high fever (over
38 degrees Celsius) the child should be taken to a trained health worker or
health centre.
Measles can be extremely dangerous for malnourished children, so they
should be immunized against measles, especially if the malnutrition is severe.

All pregnant women and their newborns need to be protected against
tetanus. Even if a woman was immunized earlier, she needs to check with a

In many parts of the world, mothers give birth in unhygienic conditions. This
puts both the mother and the child at risk of getting tetanus, a major killer of
newborn infants.

84 Facts for Life

Tetanus bacteria or spores grow in dirty cuts. These bacteria can grow if the
umbilical cord is cut with an unclean knife or if anything unclean touches the
end of the cord. Any tool used to cut the cord should be cleaned, boiled or
heated over a ﬂame, and allowed to cool. For the ﬁrst week after birth, the
baby’s umbilical stump must be kept clean. No substances should be put on
the stump.

It is safe for a pregnant woman to be immunized against tetanus. She should
be immunized according to this schedule:
First dose:

As soon as she knows she is pregnant.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

All pregnant women should make sure they have been immunized against
tetanus. This protects both mothers and newborns.

Families and communities, with support from governments and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), can do much to raise awareness of (1) what causes diarrhoea, (2) why
it is important to treat diarrhoea as soon as it starts, and (3) how to prevent the conditions
that cause it.
When everyone works together to reduce diarrhoea, children’s right to life, survival, health
and development can be better assured.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Infants who are exclusively breastfed in their ﬁrst six months and who receive all their
immunizations on time are less likely to get diarrhoea. Children with diarrhoea should be
given lots of ﬂuids and foods along with a special solution called oral rehydration salts
(ORS) and zinc to help reduce the severity of the illness.

DIARRHOEA

Diarrhoea is caused by germs that are swallowed,
especially germs from faeces. This happens most
often where there is unsafe disposal of faeces, poor hygiene practices, lack of clean drinking
water, or when infants are not breastfed.

TIMING BIRTHS

iarrhoea is the second most common cause
of death in young children, after pneumonia.
About 4 billion cases of diarrhoea are
estimated to occur every year among children
under 5. It kills more than 1.5 million children under
5 years of age every year, representing 17 per cent
of all deaths in children under 5. Children are more
likely than adults to die from diarrhoea because
they become dehydrated and malnourished
more quickly.

1.

Diarrhoea kills children by draining liquid from the body, which dehydrates
the child. As soon as diarrhoea starts, it is essential to give the child extra
ﬂuids along with regular foods and ﬂuids.

2.

A child’s life is in danger if she or he has several watery stools within an hour
or if there is blood in the stool. Immediate help from a trained health worker
is needed.

3.

Exclusive breastfeeding for the ﬁrst six months of life and continued
breastfeeding after six months can reduce the risks associated with
diarrhoea. Immunization against rotavirus (where recommended and
available) reduces deaths from diarrhoea caused by this virus. Vitamin A and
zinc supplementation can reduce the risk of diarrhoea.

4.

A child with diarrhoea needs to continue eating regularly. While recovering,
she or he needs to be offered more food than usual to replenish the energy
and nourishment lost due to the illness.

Diarrhoea kills children by draining liquid from the body, which dehydrates
the child. As soon as diarrhoea starts, it is essential to give the child extra
ﬂuids along with regular foods and ﬂuids.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

A child has diarrhoea when she or he passes three or more watery
stools a day. The more numerous the watery stools, the more dangerous
the diarrhoea.
Some people think that drinking liquids makes diarrhoea worse. This is not
true. A child with diarrhoea should be given drinks, including breastmilk,
as often as possible. Drinking lots of liquids helps to replace the ﬂuids lost
during diarrhoea.
Recommended drinks for a child with diarrhoea include:
●

breastmilk (mothers should breastfeed more often than usual)

●

oral rehydration salts (ORS) mixed with the proper amount of clean water
(refer to the box on ORS after Message 5)

●

soups

●

rice water

●

fresh fruit juices

●

clean water from a safe source. If there is a possibility the water is not
clean and safe to drink, it should be puriﬁed by boiling, ﬁltering, adding
chlorine or disinfecting with sunlight in accordance with information
provided by a trained health worker or extension agent.

TIMING BIRTHS

●

To avoid dehydration, breastfed children should breastfeed as often as
possible. Children who are not breastfeeding should drink the following
amounts of liquids every time a watery stool is passed:
for a child under the age of 2 years: between 1⁄4 and 1⁄2 of a large
(250-millilitre) cup

●

for a child 2 years or older: between 1⁄2 and 1 whole large (250-millilitre)
cup.

Drinks should be given from a clean cup. A feeding bottle should not be used.
It is difﬁcult to clean bottles completely, and unclean bottles can contain
germs that cause diarrhoea.

DIARRHOEA

●

If the child vomits, the caregiver should wait 10 minutes and then begin again
to give the drink to the child slowly, small sips at a time.

Diarrhoea usually stops after three or four days. If it lasts longer, parents or
other caregivers should seek help from a trained health worker.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

The child should be given extra liquids in addition to regular foods and drinks
until the diarrhoea has stopped.

If the child has any of these signs, help from a trained health worker is
needed urgently. In the meantime, the child should be given ORS solution
and/or other liquids, plus zinc.
If the child passes several watery stools in one hour and vomits, there is
cause for alarm – these are possible signs of cholera. Cholera can kill children
in a matter of hours. Medical help should be sought immediately and the
child should continue to receive ORS solution and zinc.
●

Cholera can spread throughout the community quickly through
contaminated water or food. Cholera usually occurs in situations where
there is poor sanitation and overcrowding.

●

There are four steps to take to limit the spread of cholera or diarrhoea:
1. Always wash hands with soap and water or a substitute, such as ash
and water, after defecation, after contact with faeces, before touching
or preparing food, before eating and before feeding children.
2. Dispose of all faeces, including those of infants and young children,
in a latrine or toilet, or bury them. Disinfect the places touched by the
faeces.
3. Use safe drinking water.
4. Wash, peel or cook all foods.

Trained health workers and health centres should provide families and
communities with clear information on the risks of diarrhoea and cholera and
what steps to take when either one occurs.

3.

Exclusive breastfeeding for the ﬁrst six months of life and continued
breastfeeding after six months can reduce the risks associated with
diarrhoea. Immunization against rotavirus (where recommended and
available) reduces deaths from diarrhoea caused by this virus. Vitamin A
and zinc supplementation can reduce the risk of diarrhoea.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Breastmilk is the best source of liquid and food for a young child with
diarrhoea. It is nutritious and clean and helps ﬁght illness and infections.
An infant who is fed only breastmilk in her or his ﬁrst six months of life is less
likely to get diarrhoea during this time.
94 Facts for Life

TIMING BIRTHS

Breastmilk prevents dehydration and malnutrition and helps replace lost
ﬂuids. Mothers are sometimes advised to give less breastmilk if a child has
diarrhoea. This advice is wrong. Mothers should breastfeed more often than
usual when the child has diarrhoea. Fathers should support mothers who are
breastfeeding by caring for the sick child and other children in the family, and
by helping with household tasks.
Rotavirus causes diarrhoea. Children should be immunized against rotavirus
in countries that offer this vaccination.

Including zinc as part of the treatment for diarrhoea for 10–14 days helps
to reduce its severity and duration, and also protects the child from future
diarrhoea episodes for up to two months. Children over 6 months of age
can take 20 milligrams per day of zinc (tablet or syrup). For children under
6 months, 10 milligrams per day (tablet or syrup) is an appropriate amount.

KEY MESSAGE

4.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

The trained health worker should show the mother, father or other caregiver
how to give the child a zinc tablet by dissolving it in a small amount of
expressed breastmilk, ORS or clean water in a small cup or spoon. If the child
is too young for a tablet, zinc syrup can be used.

DIARRHOEA

Vitamin A supplementation, particularly in areas deﬁcient in vitamin A, is
an important measure to reduce the risk of diarrhoea. Foods that contain
vitamin A include breastmilk, liver, ﬁsh, dairy products, orange or yellow
fruits and vegetables, and green leafy vegetables.

A child with diarrhoea needs to continue eating regularly. While recovering,
she or he needs to be offered more food than usual to replenish the energy
and nourishment lost due to the illness.

A child with diarrhoea loses weight and can quickly become malnourished. A
child with diarrhoea needs all the foods and ﬂuids, including breastmilk, she
or he can take. Nutritious foods will help the child recover more quickly.

Recommended foods for a child with diarrhoea are well-mashed mixes of
cereals and beans, ﬁsh, well-cooked meat, yogurt and fruits. A little oil can

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

A child with diarrhoea may not want to eat or may vomit, so feeding can be
difﬁcult. Breastfeeding should be more frequent. If the child is 6 months of
age or older, parents and other caregivers should encourage the child to eat
as often as possible, offering small amounts of soft, mashed foods or foods
the child likes. These foods should contain a small amount of salt. Soft foods
are easier to eat and contain more ﬂuid than hard foods.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

be added to cereal and vegetables, about 1 or 2 teaspoons. Foods should be
freshly prepared and given to the child ﬁve or six times a day.
After the diarrhoea stops, extra feeding is vital for a full recovery. At this time,
the child needs to be given more food than usual, including breastmilk, to
help replenish the energy and nourishment lost due to the diarrhoea.
A child is not fully recovered from diarrhoea until she or he is at least the
same weight as when the illness began.
KEY MESSAGE

5.

A child with diarrhoea should receive oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution
and a daily zinc supplement for 10–14 days. Diarrhoea medicines are
generally ineffective and can be harmful.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Diarrhoea usually cures itself in three to four days with rehydration (drinking
a lot of liquids). The real danger is the loss of liquid and nutrients from the
child’s body, which can cause dehydration and malnutrition.
A child with diarrhoea should never be given any tablets, antibiotics or other
medicines unless prescribed by a trained health worker.
The best treatment for diarrhoea is to (1) drink lots of liquids and oral
rehydration salts (ORS), properly mixed with clean water from a safe source,
and (2) take zinc tablets or syrup for 10–14 days.

96 Facts for Life

A special drink for diarrhoea
ORS (oral rehydration salts) is a special combination
of dry salts that is mixed with safe water. It can help
replace the ﬂuids lost due to diarrhoea.

When should ORS
be used?

When a child has three or more loose stools in a
day, begin to give ORS. In addition, for 10 –14 days,
give children over 6 months of age 20 milligrams of
zinc per day (tablet or syrup); give children under
6 months of age 10 milligrams per day (tablet
or syrup).

Where can ORS be
obtained?

In most countries, ORS packets are available from
health centres, pharmacies, markets and shops.

How is the ORS drink
prepared?

1. Put the contents of the ORS packet in a clean
container. Check the packet for directions and
add the correct amount of clean water. Too little
water could make the diarrhoea worse.

3. Stir well, and feed it to the child from a clean cup.
Do not use a bottle.
How much ORS
drink to give?

Encourage the child to drink as much as possible.
A child under the age of 2 years needs at least 1⁄4 to
1
⁄2 of a large (250-millilitre) cup of the ORS drink after
each watery stool.

Give the child a drink made with 6 level teaspoons
of sugar and 1⁄2 level teaspoon of salt dissolved in
1 litre of clean water.

A child aged 2 years or older needs at least 1⁄2 to
1 whole large (250-millilitre) cup of the ORS drink

To prevent diarrhoea, all faeces, including those of infants and young children,
should be disposed of in a latrine or toilet or buried.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Children and adults can swallow germs that cause diarrhoea if faeces
come in contact with drinking water, food, hands, utensils or food
preparation surfaces.
Flies that settle on faeces and then on food also transmit the germs that cause
diarrhoea. To keep away ﬂies and prevent the spread of germs, (1) dispose
of faeces safely in a latrine or toilet, (2) keep the latrine or toilet clean, and
(3) cover food and drinking water.
All faeces, even those of infants and young children, carry germs and are
dangerous. If children defecate without using the latrine or toilet, their faeces
should be cleaned up immediately and disposed of in the latrine or toilet or
buried. Afterwards, hands should always be washed with soap and water.
If soap is not available, ash and water can be used as a substitute. Men and
boys can help women and girls in disposing of the faeces.
If there is no toilet or latrine, adults and children should defecate away from
houses, paths, water supplies and places where children play. Faeces should
then be buried under a layer of soil. Human and animal faeces should be kept
away from water sources.
In communities without toilets or latrines, the community should consider
joining together to build such facilities. Households can be encouraged to
build their own.

98 Facts for Life

7.

Good hygiene practices and use of safe drinking water protect against
diarrhoea. Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water or a
substitute, such as ash and water, after defecating and after contact with
faeces, and before touching or preparing food or feeding children.

TIMING BIRTHS

KEY MESSAGE

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Young children frequently put their hands in their mouths. So it is important
to keep the household area clean and to teach children to wash their hands
properly and frequently, especially after defecating and before eating.

DIARRHOEA

Hands should always be washed with soap and water or a substitute, such as
ash and water, after defecating, after helping children use the toilet or latrine,
after cleaning the baby’s bottom, after disposing of refuse, and immediately
before feeding children, handling food or eating.

Using safe drinking water and keeping it clean and free of germs helps to
reduce diarrhoea.

●

peel fruit and vegetables or wash them thoroughly with clean water,
especially if young children eat them raw

●

prepare and thoroughly cook food just before eating (Food left standing
can collect germs that can cause diarrhoea. After two hours, cooked foods
are not safe unless they are kept very hot or very cold.)

●

bury, burn or safely dispose of all food refuse to stop ﬂies from spreading
disease.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Babies and very young children lose their body heat easily. When they have a
cough or cold they should be kept covered and warm.
Children with coughs, colds, runny noses or sore throats who are breathing
normally can be treated at home and will recover without medicines. They
need to be kept warm, but not overheated, and to be given plenty to eat and
drink. Medicines should be used only if prescribed by a trained health worker.
A child with a fever needs careful attention. She or he should be sponged or
bathed with cool but not cold water. The child should be kept well hydrated
with additional ﬂuids. In areas where malaria is common, the fever could
be caused by malaria, which is dangerous to the health and survival of the
child. A child with a fever in these areas should be checked by a trained health
worker immediately.
The nose of a child with a cough or cold should be cleared often, especially
before the child eats or goes to sleep. A moist atmosphere can make breathing
easier. It can help if the child breathes water vapour from a bowl of water that
is hot but not boiling. The parent or other caregiver should make certain the
water is not too hot and that the child is carefully supervised when breathing the
water vapour.
A breastfed child who has a cough or cold may have difﬁculty breastfeeding.
Since breastfeeding helps to ﬁght the illness and is important for the child’s
growth, the mother should continue to breastfeed often. If a child cannot

be fed from the cup by the mother, father or other caregiver. Before putting
the baby to the breast or feeding the baby breastmilk (or breastmilk substitute)
from a cup, it helps to clear the baby’s nose if it is blocked with secretions.
Children who are 6 months of age or older should be encouraged to breastfeed,
eat and drink frequently. When the illness is over, the child should be given extra
nutritious foods every day until she or he is at least the same weight as before

3.

Families can help prevent pneumonia by making sure babies are exclusively
breastfed for the ﬁrst six months and that all children are well nourished
and fully immunized.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Breastfeeding helps to protect babies from pneumonia and other illnesses. It
is important to give breastmilk alone for the ﬁrst six months of a baby’s life.
After 6 months of age, a child should eat a variety of healthy foods, and
continue to be breastfed, to ensure that she or he gets the nutrients necessary
to stay healthy and be less susceptible to respiratory infections and other
illnesses. Some examples of healthy foods include fruits and vegetables
(including green leafy vegetables), liver, red palm oil, dairy products, ﬁsh
and eggs.
Safe water and good hygiene practices help to reduce the number of
respiratory infections and other illnesses, such as diarrhoea. These practices
include washing vegetables and fruits, keeping food preparation surfaces
clean, and washing hands with soap and water or with a substitute, such as
ash and water.
Every child should complete a recommended series of immunizations.
Early protection is critical; the immunizations in the ﬁrst year and into the
second year are especially important. The child will then be protected against
measles, pertussis (whooping cough), tuberculosis and other respiratory
illnesses, which can lead to pneumonia.
Parents and other caregivers should ensure that both girls and boys are
equally provided with a varied and healthy diet and all immunizations. Health
workers can provide parents and other caregivers with information on diets,
hygiene and immunizations and how they protect against pneumonia and
other illnesses.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Children are more likely to get pneumonia and other breathing illnesses if
they live in an environment with smoke.

Tobacco use generally begins during adolescence. Adolescents are more
likely to start smoking if (1) the adults around them smoke, (2) tobacco
advertising and promotion are common, and (3) tobacco products are cheap
and easily accessible. Adolescents should be encouraged to avoid smoking
and caution their friends about its dangers.

Parents and other caregivers need to be aware of the detrimental effects of
second-hand smoke and take responsibility to refrain from smoking around
children. Governments and communities can work together to inform the
public of the harmful effects of smoky environments and second-hand smoke
on children.
Supporting Information 107

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Second-hand smoke is particularly harmful to young children. It stays in the
air for hours after cigarettes, pipes or cigars have been put out. Non-smokers
who inhale this smoke are more vulnerable to respiratory infections, asthma
and cancer.

Exposure to smoke can harm a child, even before birth. Pregnant women
should not smoke or be exposed to smoke. Babies especially should be kept
out of smoky kitchens and away from cooking ﬁres.

any other age group to the ill effects of
unsafe water, poor sanitation and lack of
hygiene. These contribute to 88 per cent of deaths
from diarrhoeal diseases. Children under 5 years
old account for nearly 90 per cent of deaths
from diarrhoea.

Y

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

The simple habit of handwashing with soap is
estimated to reduce the incidence of diarrhoea
by nearly half. It also greatly reduces the risk
of respiratory infections such as pneumonia
and other diseases, including eye infections,
especially trachoma.
Parents and caregivers should wash their hands with soap and water at these critical
moments: (1) after cleaning the infant or young child who has defecated, (2) after helping
the child use the toilet or latrine, (3) after going to the latrine or toilet themselves, (4) before
touching food and feeding young children, and (5) after dealing with refuse.

The use of latrines and toilets together with good hygiene practices – speciﬁcally hand
washing with soap – are essential public health tools. They protect children and families at
little cost and help realize children’s right to good health and nutrition.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Parents and caregivers need to help children develop the habit of washing their hands with
soap before eating and after using the latrine or toilet. Where soap is not available hands
can be washed with ash and water. Animal and human faeces should be kept away from
houses, paths, water sources and children’s play areas.

Everyone in the community needs to work together to build and use toilets or latrines,
practise good hygiene, protect water sources, and safely dispose of waste water and refuse.

HYGIENE

It is important for governments to support communities by providing information on how to
design and build latrines and toilets that all families can afford. In urban areas particularly,
government support is also needed for low-cost sanitation and drainage systems, safe
drinking water and refuse collection.

All faeces, including those of babies and young children, should be disposed
of safely. Making sure that all family members use a toilet, latrine or potty
(for young children) is the best way to dispose of faeces. Where there is no
toilet, faeces should be buried.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Many illnesses, especially diarrhoea, come from germs found in human
faeces. If the germs get into water or onto food, hands, utensils or surfaces
used for preparing and serving food, they can be swallowed and cause
illness. Safe disposal of all faeces – both human and animal – is the single
most important action to prevent the spread of germs by people or ﬂies.
Human faeces need to be put down a toilet or latrine, or buried.
All faeces, including those of babies and young children, carry germs and are
dangerous. If children defecate without using a toilet or latrine, their faeces
should be cleaned up immediately and ﬂushed down the toilet or put down
the latrine or buried. Parents’ or other caregivers’ and children’s hands should
then be washed with soap and water or a substitute, such as ash and water.
If it is not possible to use a toilet or latrine, everyone should always defecate
well away from houses, paths, water sources and places where children play.
The faeces should then be buried immediately. Animal faeces also need to be
kept away from the houses, paths and areas where children play.
Latrines and toilets need to be cleaned frequently. Latrines should be
kept covered and toilets should be ﬂushed. A clean latrine attracts fewer

ﬂies. People are more likely to use a clean latrine. Local governments
and non-governmental organizations can often advise households and
communities on the design, materials and construction for building low-cost
sanitary latrines.
In urban areas, the government and communities should work together to
determine how to install low-cost latrines or toilets, sanitation and drainage
systems, safe drinking water and refuse collection.
KEY MESSAGE

All family members, including children, need to wash their hands thoroughly
with soap and water after any contact with faeces, before touching or
preparing food, and before feeding children. Where soap is not available,
a substitute, such as ash and water, can be used.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

●

It is especially important to wash the hands with soap after defecating and
after cleaning the bottom of a baby or child who has just defecated. It is
also important to wash hands after handling animals and raw foods.

●

Hands should always be washed before preparing, serving or eating food,
and before feeding children. Children should be taught to wash both
hands rubbed together with soap after defecating and before eating to
help protect them from illness.

HYGIENE

Children often put their hands into their mouths, so it is important to
wash their hands often, especially after they have been playing in dirt or
with animals. Washing a child’s body regularly is also important to avoid
skin infections.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Washing the hands with soap and water removes germs. Rinsing the ﬁngers
with water is not enough – both hands need to be rubbed together with soap
and water, and then rinsed with water. This helps to stop germs and dirt
from getting onto food or into the mouth. Washing hands can also prevent
infection with worms. Soap and water should be placed conveniently near the
latrine or toilet. Where soap is not available, ash and water can be used.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

2.

Children are easily infected with worms, which deplete the body’s nutrients.
Worms and their eggs can be found in human and animal faeces and urine, in
surface water and soil, and in poorly cooked meat.
Children should not play near the latrine, toilet or defecation areas. Shoes
or sandals should be worn near latrines to prevent worms from entering
the body through the skin of the feet.

●

Children living in areas where worms are common should be treated two
to three times per year with a recommended deworming medication.

Washing hands with soap and water after handling poultry or poultry
products, after touching eggs and raw meat, and after cleaning the place
where poultry is kept can also help prevent the spread of germs and avian
inﬂuenza (bird ﬂu).

Washing the face and hands with soap and water every day helps to
prevent eye infections. In some parts of the world, eye infections can lead to
trachoma, which can cause blindness.

3.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Flies carry germs. A dirty face attracts ﬂies, spreading the germs from person
to person. If the eyes become sore or infected, vision may be impaired or lost.
Eyes must be kept clean and healthy.
If the eyes are healthy, the white part is clear, the eyes are moist and shiny,
and vision is sharp. If the eyes are extremely dry or very red and sore, if there
is a discharge or if there is difﬁculty seeing, the child should be examined by
a trained health worker as soon as possible.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Families have fewer illnesses when they have an adequate supply of safe
water and know how to keep it clean and free from germs. If the water is not
clean it can be puriﬁed using low-cost solutions at home. It can be (1) boiled,
(2) cleaned through a ﬁlter, (3) puriﬁed with chlorine or (4) disinfected with
sunlight or other simple measures.10 The trained health worker or extension
agent should have information on home treatments that are available locally.

wells and springs – is best avoided. If necessary it can be made safer by the
home-based water treatment methods referred to above. Water should be
safely stored in a covered container that is clean on the inside and outside.
Families and communities can protect their water supply by:

●

protecting a spring with a spring box

●

disposing of faeces and waste water (especially from latrines and
household cleaning) well away from any water source used for cooking,
drinking or washing

●

building latrines at least 15 metres away and downhill from a water

●

always keeping jerry-cans, buckets, pitchers, ropes and jars used to collect
and store water as clean as possible by storing them in a clean place, off
the ground and away from animals

●

keeping all animals away from drinking water sources and family living

Raw or leftover cooked food can be dangerous. Raw food should be washed
or cooked. Cooked food should be eaten without delay or thoroughly
reheated before eating.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Cooking food thoroughly kills germs. Food, especially meat and poultry,
should be cooked all the way through.
Germs grow quickly in warm food. Food should be eaten as soon as possible
after cooking so it does not have time to collect germs.
●

If food has to be kept for more than two hours, it should be kept either
very hot or very cool.

●

If cooked food is saved for another meal, it should be covered to keep off
ﬂies and insects and then thoroughly reheated before being eaten.

●

Yogurt and sour porridge are good to use in the preparation of meals
because their acid prevents the growth of germs.

Raw food, especially poultry and seafood, usually contains germs. Cooked
food can collect germs if it touches raw food, and these germs can breed in
the cooked food in a few hours. Raw and cooked foods should always be kept
separate. Knives, chopping boards and surfaces should always be cleaned
with soap and water after preparing raw food.
●

Special care should be taken in preparing food for infants and small
children. Their food should be freshly made and eaten immediately, not
left standing.

●

Breastmilk is the safest (and most nutritious) milk for infants and young
children. Expressed breastmilk can be stored at room temperature for up
to eight hours in a clean, covered container. If older children are given
animal milk it should be freshly boiled or pasteurized (a special way of
heating milk to destroy harmful bacteria).

●

All poultry and poultry products should be cooked the whole way through
to prevent the spread of avian inﬂuenza (bird ﬂu).

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Hygienic menstruation practices among adolescent girls and women should
be promoted and supported.

●

Water and soap should be provided in a private place (bathing area,
latrine) for girls and women to wash during menstruation and for washing
their hands after changing their cloth/napkin. Poor menstruation hygiene
can lead to fungal infections. Repeated infections can lead to serious
reproductive tract infections. These could cause infertility.

●

Schools should have separate latrines for girls and boys. The girls’
latrine in particular needs access to water and soap so girls can clean
themselves. Latrines that are private, clean and safe contribute to keeping
girls in school longer, which can delay early marriage and pregnancy.

When girls and women are menstruating, their privacy needs to be respected.

HYGIENE

Clean and dry feminine hygiene products such as cloths or napkins
should be available. Where cloths are used it is important that they are

alaria is a serious disease spread
through mosquito bites. The World Health
Organization estimates that around
250 million malaria episodes occurred in 2006,
resulting in nearly 1 million deaths. About 90 per
cent of all malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan
Africa, most among children under age 5.

M

Malaria is particularly dangerous for pregnant women. Some 50 million pregnant women
are exposed to malaria each year. Malaria during pregnancy contributes to nearly
20 per cent of low-birthweight babies in endemic areas, plus anaemia, stillbirth and even
maternal deaths.

Many lives can be saved by preventing malaria and treating it early. Children and their
family members have the right to quality health care for prompt and effective treatment and
malaria prevention.

BREASTFEEDING

Governments, in collaboration with communities and non-governmental and communitybased organizations, can minimize the number of malaria cases. They need to support
preventive actions, such as distributing long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets for
families to sleep under.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Malaria is spread by the bite of an Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito transfers the
malaria parasite, Plasmodium, from person to person. People get very sick with high
fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, chills and ﬂu-like illness. Especially in children, the
disease can worsen rapidly, causing coma and death. Children under 5 years old are most
susceptible to malaria because they have very little acquired immunity to resist it.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Malaria is found in many regions of the world. In
sub-Saharan Africa, it is a leading cause of death,
illness, and poor growth and development among
young children. It is estimated that a child dies of
malaria every 30 seconds in this area.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

All members of the community should be protected against mosquito bites,
particularly young children and pregnant women. Protection is needed after
sunset and before sunrise, when malaria mosquitoes bite.
Long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets last for at least three years
and do not require re-treatment with insecticide. These nets are distributed
by malaria control programmes and can be obtained through health facilities
or during child health days or integrated campaigns. Most mosquito nets are
distributed free of charge, especially to pregnant women and young children.
They can also be purchased in the marketplace or through social marketing
programmes, mainly in urban areas. In the few cases where untreated nets
might still be in use, trained health workers can advise on safe insecticides
and re-treatment.
Insecticide-treated mosquito nets should be used throughout the year, even
when there are fewer mosquitoes, such as during the dry season.
Some countries operate programmes to spray the walls of houses with longlasting insecticides to kill resting mosquitoes. Communities should cooperate
with spray teams to ensure that all houses are sprayed.

124 Facts for Life

In addition to using insecticide-treated mosquito nets, or if mosquito nets
are not available or used, other actions can help, but they are not nearly as
effective as using mosquito nets:
putting screens on doors and windows; these are mostly used in urban
settings and are not very effective in traditional rural housing

●

using mosquito coils; these are used to repel but not kill mosquitoes –
they have no lasting effect

●

wearing clothing that covers the arms and legs (long sleeves and long
trousers or skirts); these can help reduce mosquito bites if worn when
malaria mosquitoes are most active – from dusk until dawn.

Malaria should be suspected if anyone in the family has a fever, or if young
children refuse to eat or have vomiting, diarrhoea, drowsiness or ﬁts.
A child with a fever believed to be caused by malaria needs immediate
antimalarial treatment as recommended by a trained health worker. If
possible, the child should be tested with a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) or
microscopy (laboratory diagnosis involving the examination of the person’s
blood under a microscope) to conﬁrm the malaria infection. RDTs are
inexpensive and increasingly available.

Malaria usually causes a high fever and chills. A child with a high fever should
be kept cool for as long as the fever persists by:

Keeping the fever from going too high is important to prevent convulsions,
which could lead to disabilities.

A child with malaria needs to take the full course of treatment, even if the
fever disappears rapidly. If the treatment is not completed, the malaria could
become more severe and difﬁcult to cure. Incomplete treatment regimens
can also lead to the development of drug resistance among people in the
local area.
If the malaria symptoms continue after treatment, the child should be taken to
a health centre or hospital. The problem may be:
●

the child is not receiving enough medicine

●

the child has an illness other than malaria

●

the malaria is resistant to the medicine, and another medicine is needed.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Pregnant women are more likely to suffer from malaria than other women.
The disease is more dangerous during pregnancy, especially during the ﬁrst
pregnancy. This is due to changes in a woman’s body that lower her previous
level of resistance to malaria. Malaria can cause severe anaemia (‘thin
blood’), miscarriage, premature birth or stillbirth.
Babies born to mothers who have had malaria during pregnancy are often
underweight. This makes them more vulnerable to infection or death during
their ﬁrst year.
Women in their ﬁrst pregnancy in areas where malaria is prevalent often do
not show the typical signs of malaria.
As preventive treatment, pregnant women in malarial areas, especially those
in their ﬁrst pregnancy who can be asymptomatic (without symptoms),
should take antimalarial tablets in the second and third trimesters as
recommended by a trained health worker. The health worker will know which
antimalarial tablets are best to take.

126 Facts for Life

It is also very important that pregnant women sleep under insecticide-treated
mosquito nets.
Pregnant women with signs and symptoms of Plasmodium falciparum
malaria must be treated immediately by a trained health worker with quinine

KEY MESSAGE

A child suffering or recovering from malaria needs plenty of liquids and food.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

A girl or boy suffering from malaria should be offered liquids and foods
frequently to help prevent dehydration and malnutrition.
Frequent breastfeeding prevents dehydration and helps the child ﬁght

HIV

H

Although HIV is still incurable, it is a manageable condition. If infected infants and children
are diagnosed early, receive effective treatment and take antiretroviral drugs as prescribed,
they have a better chance to grow, learn, develop and have dreams for the future.

Adolescents and young people 15–24 years old accounted for about 45 per cent of all
new HIV infections among people aged 15 and older in 2007. HIV is more common among
adolescent girls and young women than adolescent boys and young men. Life skills
education is critical for children, adolescents and young people so that they acquire the
knowledge and skills to make healthy life choices.

Introduction 129

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Governments, with support from families, communities and non-governmental and faithbased organizations, have a responsibility to ensure people’s right to information on HIV
prevention, treatment and care. They also have the responsibility to ensure the rights of
children living with or affected by HIV to protection, care and support. It is important that
children, families and communities help stop the spread of HIV.

BREASTFEEDING

Families and communities, especially women and girls, are the ﬁrst lines of protection and
care for children living with or affected by HIV. Families should receive the support they
need to provide their children with a nurturing and protective environment. Keeping HIVpositive mothers and fathers alive and healthy is vital for children’s growth, development
and stability. Without the security of the family, children run a greater risk of being exploited
and discriminated against.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Children are among the most vulnerable to HIV. But they typically receive the fewest
services. The disease can progress rapidly in young children. Antiretroviral drugs are used to
treat HIV because they restore the immune system and delay progression to AIDS. However,
most children infected with HIV do not begin taking these drugs until they are 5–9 years old.
This is too late. Without antiretroviral treatment, half of all babies born with HIV will die by
their second birthday.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

HIV is transmitted through (1) unprotected sex
with an HIV-infected person; (2) an HIV-infected
woman to her baby during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding; and (3) blood from
HIV-contaminated syringes, needles or other sharp instruments and from transfusion with
HIV-contaminated blood. HIV is not transmitted through casual contact or by other means.

HIV AND
HIV AIDS

IV (human immunodeﬁciency virus) is
the virus that causes AIDS (acquired
immunodeﬁciency syndrome). HIV touches
the lives of children and families in every country
in the world. Over 2 million children under age
15 are living with HIV (infected with HIV). Millions
more are affected by HIV (not infected but living
in families with infected members). An estimated
17.5 million children have lost one or both parents
to AIDS; more than 14 million of these children live
in sub-Saharan Africa. (Latest data available, 2007)

People can become infected with HIV through (1) unprotected sexual contact with
an HIV-infected person (sex without the use of a male or female condom); (2)
transmission from an HIV-infected mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth
or breastfeeding; and (3) blood from HIV-contaminated syringes, needles or
other sharp instruments and transfusion with HIV-contaminated blood. It is not
transmitted by casual contact or other means.

2.

Anyone who wants to know how to prevent HIV or thinks he or she has HIV
should contact a health-care provider or an AIDS centre to obtain information on
HIV prevention and/or advice on where to receive HIV testing, counselling, care
and support.

3.

All pregnant women should talk to their health-care providers about HIV. All
pregnant women who think they, their partners or family members are infected
with HIV, have been exposed to HIV or live in a setting with a generalized HIV
epidemic should get an HIV test and counselling to learn how to protect or care for
themselves and their children, partners and family members.

4.

All children born to HIV-positive mothers or to parents with symptoms, signs or
conditions associated with HIV infection should be tested for HIV. If found to be
HIV-positive, they should be referred for follow-up care and treatment and given
loving care and support.

5.

Parents or other caregivers should talk with their daughters and sons about
relationships, sex and their vulnerability to HIV infection. Girls and young women are
especially vulnerable to HIV infection. Girls and boys need to learn how to avoid, reject
or defend themselves against sexual harassment, violence and peer pressure. They
need to understand the importance of equality and respect in relationships.

130 Facts for Life

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Children and adolescents should actively participate in making and implementing
decisions on HIV prevention, care and support that affect them, their families and
their communities.

8.

Families affected by HIV may need income support and social welfare services
to help them take care of sick family members and children. Families should be
guided and assisted in accessing these services.

9.

No child or adult living with or affected by HIV should ever be stigmatized or
discriminated against. Parents, teachers and leaders have a key role to play in HIV
education and prevention and in reducing fear, stigma and discrimination.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

People infected with HIV usually live for years without any signs of the
disease. They may look and feel healthy, but they can still pass on the virus to
others. Timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), a group of medicines
used to treat HIV, allows a person to handle HIV as a chronic disease and lead
a relatively healthy life.
AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection. People who have AIDS grow weaker
because their bodies lose the ability to ﬁght off illnesses. In adults not
receiving antiretroviral treatment, AIDS develops 7–10 years after HIV
infection, on average. In young children it usually develops much faster. There
is no cure for AIDS, but new medicines can help people with AIDS live longer.
In most cases, HIV is passed from one person to another through unprotected
sexual intercourse, during which the semen, vaginal ﬂuid or blood of an
infected person passes into the body of another person.

132 Facts for Life

HIV

HIV can also pass from one person to another through the use of non-sterile,
HIV-contaminated needles and syringes (most often among drug users
sharing needles and syringes), razor blades, knives or other instruments for
injecting, cutting or piercing the body.
People may also become infected by HIV through transfusions of infected
blood. All blood for transfusions should be screened for HIV.
HIV is passed to infants and young children primarily from the mother during
pregnancy or childbirth or through breastfeeding.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

It is not possible to get HIV from working, socializing or living side by side
with HIV-positive people. Touching those who are infected with HIV, hugging,
shaking hands, coughing and sneezing will not spread the disease. HIV
cannot be transmitted through toilet seats, telephones, plates, cups, eating
utensils, towels, bed linen, swimming pools or public baths. HIV is not spread
by mosquitoes or other insects.
KEY MESSAGE

Anyone who wants to know how to prevent HIV or thinks he or she has HIV
should contact a health-care provider or an AIDS centre to obtain information

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Information on HIV and on services and education to learn how to prevent or
reduce the risk of infection is increasingly available in almost every country.
Information can be found at health centres, ﬁxed and mobile HIV care
units, testing and counselling centres, youth centres and in many schools.
Information is also available through the internet and other media.

Voluntary HIV testing and counselling can help people make informed choices
about their health and their sexual behaviour. It can help couples decide
whether or not to have children. If one partner has HIV there is a risk the other
partner can become infected while trying to conceive. If a couple is expecting
a baby, testing and counselling can help them make decisions regarding the
health of their baby.
Counselling and testing can also help those not infected to remain uninfected
through education about ways to avoid risk, including safer sex choices.
There are many types of HIV tests. It is important to talk to a professional to
learn about the type of test being used and its accuracy.
If the result of an HIV test is negative, this means the person tested is not
infected or it is too early to detect the virus. In adults, the HIV blood test may
not detect infection for up to six weeks after exposure. Depending on the
test, detection in babies may take up to 18 months after birth. However, early
infant diagnosis (EID) can be conducted as early as six weeks.
Families and communities should insist on and support conﬁdential HIV
testing, counselling and information. Conﬁdentiality helps protect children,
adolescents and adults from experiencing stigma, discrimination, exclusion
and isolation.
Counselling can help to empower women and adolescent girls, promote
safer sex and condom use, and help detect and facilitate treatment of
sexually transmitted infections – all of which can reduce the chances of
HIV infection. If a woman or adolescent girl is diagnosed with HIV and has
children or is pregnant, assistance may be required to help her protect, care
for and support her children. Community support groups and NGOs often
provide assistance.
Increasing access to testing followed by treatment, care and support can help
to reduce stigma by demonstrating that HIV is not a ‘death sentence’ and
that many people infected with HIV can lead relatively healthy, happy and
productive lives.

All pregnant women should talk to their health-care providers about HIV.
All pregnant women who think they, their partners or family members

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

The HIV-positive woman should be encouraged to have her partner and
other children tested and counselled. If any test results are positive, HIV care,
treatment, and other prevention and health-care services should be offered.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

In many countries, pregnancy is the only time when women seek health
services. This provides them an important opportunity to receive an HIV test
and counselling whether in high- or low-level epidemic areas. If a woman is
found to be HIV-positive, she should have access to counselling, referrals, HIV
care and treatment, and other health-care services. Health-care and support
services for the mother will help reduce the risk of HIV transmission to
the baby.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

The most effective way to reduce transmission of HIV from the mother to
the child is to prevent women from becoming infected with HIV. Access to
family planning services and condoms for women and men are critical to
prevent HIV transmission.

A pregnant woman infected with HIV can take antiretroviral drugs. This
can help improve her own health and also reduce the chances of her child
becoming infected.

Supporting Information 135

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

An HIV-positive mother of a newborn should be provided with information
and skills to select the best feeding option for her baby. She should receive
nutrition and health-care counselling for the newborn and herself and be
supported in having her child tested and treated for exposure to HIV. She
should be informed that babies born to HIV-positive women who have not
taken antiretroviral medicines during pregnancy have about a 1 in 3 chance of
being born with HIV. Without intervention, half of the babies infected with HIV
die before they are 2 years of age.

BREASTFEEDING

The risk of transmitting HIV to infants may be reduced to less than 2 per
cent if pregnant women receive comprehensive counselling, health care and
antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy and through the ﬁrst six months
after childbirth. This is often part of a comprehensive programme called
Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT).

A pregnant woman infected with HIV needs to know that:
●

taking speciﬁc medicines (antiretroviral drugs) during pregnancy can
help improve her health and reduce the risk of passing the infection to
the infant

●

prenatal and post-natal care – visiting a skilled birth attendant for checkups before and after the birth of the baby and receiving care during
pregnancy and childbirth – can help reduce the risk of passing the
infection to the infant

●

starting HIV-exposed newborns on cotrimoxazole or Bactrim between
4 and 6 weeks of age and continuing it until HIV infection can be
deﬁnitively ruled out can help prevent ‘opportunistic’ infections (infections
that take advantage of a weakened immune system)

●

there are various infant feeding practices, each with advantages and risks.

The mother needs to decide which infant feeding practice is the safest and
the most manageable for her circumstances:
●

exclusive breastfeeding for the ﬁrst six months of the child’s life protects
the infant from death due to diarrhoea, pneumonia and malnutrition.
There is, however, a risk of HIV infection through the breastmilk. The
risk of transmitting HIV to the infant is much lower with exclusive
breastfeeding than with mixed feeding (breastmilk and other foods
and drinks). The risk can also be reduced by shortening the duration
of breastfeeding once a nutritionally adequate and safe diet without
breastmilk can be provided to the child.

●

feeding the baby a breastmilk substitute (infant formula) alone eliminates
the risk of transmitting HIV through breastmilk but can greatly increase
the risk of dying from infections such as diarrhoea or pneumonia,
especially in the ﬁrst 6 months of life. This is a good option only if the
mother has access to clean water and the means to obtain the formula for
at least 12 months, and the use of infant formula is acceptable to her and
her community.

●

breastfeeding beyond 6 months should continue until safe and adequate
replacement foods, including infant formula and other milks and foods,
are available. Once a nutritionally adequate and safe diet can be provided,
all breastfeeding should stop.

●

all infants, whether they are receiving breastmilk or breastmilk
substitutes, should receive other nutritious foods and drinks from
6 months of age onward to provide the energy and nutrients needed to
support their growth and development.

(Refer to Message 6 in the Breastfeeding chapter for more information.)

136 Facts for Life

KEY MESSAGE

All children born to HIV-positive mothers or to parents with symptoms, signs
or conditions associated with HIV infection should be tested for HIV. If found
to be HIV-positive, they should be referred for follow-up care and treatment
and given loving care and support.

HIV

4.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

The health-care provider should recommend HIV testing and counselling
as part of standard care to all children, adolescents and adults who exhibit
signs, symptoms or medical conditions that could indicate HIV infection
or who have been exposed to HIV. HIV testing and counselling should be
recommended for all children seen in health services in settings where there
is a generalized HIV epidemic.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

A child whose mother is known to be HIV-positive should be tested for HIV
within six weeks of birth or as soon as possible. Infants have their mother’s
antibodies for several weeks after birth, and therefore standard antibody tests
are not accurate for them. A special polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is
required to tell if an infant has the virus around 6 weeks of age. If positive, the
child needs to begin treatment immediately. The health-care provider can help
the family set up a feasible and appropriate antiretroviral therapy regimen for
the child. The parents should receive counselling and social services.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

The earlier a child is tested, diagnosed with HIV and started on HIV
treatment, the better the chance of his or her survival and living a longer and
healthier life.

An important part of HIV care and antiretroviral treatment (ART) for children is
the antibiotic cotrimoxazole. It helps prevent ‘opportunistic’ infections related
to HIV, especially PCP (pneumocystis pneumonia). This treatment is called
cotrimoxazole preventive therapy, or CPT.
BREASTFEEDING

Children with HIV should be given ART in ﬁxed-dose combinations. These
can be prescribed by a trained health worker, who can also provide follow-up
support. If the child is going to school, the school can also provide support to
make sure that the child takes the medicines while at school.
It is critical to encourage children taking ART to keep taking the medicines
on the recommended schedule. This will help ensure the treatment
remains effective.

Supporting Information 137

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Children need a healthy, balanced diet under any circumstances, but when
they receive HIV treatment, ensuring proper nutrition is especially important.

HIV or opportunistic infections may cause reduced food intake due to
decreased appetite, difﬁculty swallowing or poor absorption. Therefore, extra
attention should be given to the nutrition of children who are HIV-positive to
make sure they receive high-quality, easily digestible foods. Without proper
nutrition, their growth and development can be hindered. This could lead
to more opportunistic infections that further deplete children’s energy and
increase their nutritional needs.
Once children who are HIV-positive are old enough to understand, they need
to be involved in decisions about their medical care and support. They also
should be made aware of the importance of prompt care and treatment of
infections. This is a critical part of developing their ability to make healthy
decisions in the future.
KEY MESSAGE

5.

Parents or other caregivers should talk with their daughters and sons about
relationships, sex and their vulnerability to HIV infection. Girls and young
women are especially vulnerable to HIV infection. Girls and boys need to
learn how to avoid, reject or defend themselves against sexual harassment,
violence and peer pressure. They need to understand the importance of
equality and respect in relationships.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

While children need to know the biological facts about sex, they also need
to understand that sexual relationships involve caring and responsibility.
Discussing and stressing the emotional aspect of a sexual relationship with
children can help them make healthy decisions and resist peer pressure as
they grow and develop. It is important to talk about sex in a way that ﬁts the
child’s age and stage of development, and conveys values.
Everyone needs to be aware of the fact that adolescent girls and young
women are especially vulnerable to HIV infection. Adolescent girls and young
women need support to protect themselves from unwanted and unsafe sex.
In many countries, HIV rates are higher among adolescent girls than
adolescent boys.
Adolescent girls are more susceptible to HIV infection because:
●

they may not have a choice about when to have sex or whether a condom
is used

138 Facts for Life

their vaginal membranes are thinner than those of mature women
and thus susceptible to lesions from sexual activity that can allow HIV
infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to enter

●

they sometimes are targeted by and engage in relationships with older
men who may be infected

●

they are vulnerable to being sexually exploited and trafﬁcked, which puts
them in high-risk situations.

Girls and women need to know what to do and where to go if they
have been victims of sexual assault. They should seek the support of a
trained health worker or go to a health facility for medical attention and
counselling. Health-care providers and social workers should be trained to
be understanding of girls and women in these situations. This information
also applies to cases involving boys.

Discussions at home, in school and in the community between children
and adolescents and their parents, teachers, community leaders and other
role models can help develop healthy attitudes and behaviours. They can
contribute to:
respect for girls and women and their rights

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Adolescents need to be supported in learning the life skills that can help
them protect themselves in situations where they could be vulnerable
to HIV infection. These skills include problem solving, decision-making,
goal setting, critical thinking, communication, assertiveness and
self-awareness. Adolescents also need skills for coping with stressful or
confrontational situations.
Adolescents and young people look to parents, teachers, peer leaders and
other role models for guidance. These role models should develop their base
of knowledge on HIV so they will know how to communicate about HIV and
how to share important life skills.
Adolescents need to know the risks of HIV. They need to understand how it is
passed through unprotected sex with an infected person or through the use
of contaminated needles or syringes for injecting drugs. They should know
about safer practices and the consequences of lifestyle choices. They should
also know how HIV is not transmitted so they can reject myths and prevent
discrimination against people living with HIV that is based on unfounded
fears of contagion.
It is important to know and reduce the risks of getting HIV from
unprotected sex:
The risk of getting HIV can be reduced if people do not have sex. If they have
sex, correct and consistent use of male or female condoms is important. To
reduce risk, people can:
●

decrease their number of sex partners

●

stay in a mutually faithful relationship with a partner(s) who is not
infected

●

have safer sex – sex without penetration (where the penis does not
enter the vagina, rectum or mouth) or penetrative sex using a condom
correctly (as the directions indicate) and consistently (during every act of
penetrative sex).

In combination with safer practices, male circumcision reduces the possibility
of transmission of HIV infection from female to male.
The more sex partners people have, the greater the risk that one of them
will have HIV and pass it on (if they do not use male or female condoms
consistently and correctly).
However, anyone can have HIV – it is not restricted to those with many sex
partners. People who do not show signs of infection may carry the virus.
Testing is the only sure way to tell.
A well-lubricated condom is essential for protection during vaginal or
anal intercourse.
140 Facts for Life

●

The female condom is a safe alternative to the male condom. The most
commonly used female condom is a soft, loose-ﬁtting sheath that lines
the vagina. It has a soft ring at each end. The ring at the closed end is
used to put the device inside the vagina; it holds the condom in place
during sex. The other ring stays outside the vagina and partly covers the
labia. Before sex begins, the woman inserts the female condom with her
ﬁngers. Only water-based lubricants should be used with female condoms
made of latex, whereas water-based or oil-based lubricants can be used
with female condoms made of polyurethane or artiﬁcial latex (nitrile).

Because most sexually transmitted infections can be spread through genital
contact, a condom should be used before genital contact begins.
Drinking alcohol or taking drugs interferes with judgement. Even those who
understand the risks of HIV and the importance of safer sex may become
careless after drinking or using drugs.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

HIV can be transmitted through oral sex, although available information
suggests the risk is minimal as compared to vaginal and anal sex. However,
oral sex can transmit STIs which can increase the risk of HIV transmission. In
the case of oral-penile sex, a male condom is recommended.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

The male condoms that come with lubrication (slippery liquid or gel) are
less likely to tear during handling or use. If the condom is not lubricated
enough, a water-based lubricant, such as silicone or glycerin, should be
added. If such lubricants are not available, saliva can be used (although
this can transmit other infections, such as herpes). Lubricants made from
oil or petroleum should never be used with a male condom because they
can damage the condom. Oil or petroleum lubricants include cooking oil,
shortening, mineral oil, baby oil, petroleum jellies and most lotions.

People who have sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are at greater risk of
getting HIV and spreading HIV to others:
BREASTFEEDING

STIs, including HIV, are infections that are spread through sexual contact.
They can be spread through the exchange of body ﬂuids (semen, vaginal ﬂuid
or blood) or by contact with the skin of the genital area. STIs are spread more
easily if there are lesions such as blisters, abrasions or cuts. STIs often cause
lesions, which contribute to spreading the infection.
STIs often cause serious physical suffering and damage.

intercourse or practise safer sex (non-penetrative sex or sex using a male
or female condom).
●

Correct and consistent use of male and female condoms when engaging
in sexual intercourse – vaginal, anal or oral – can greatly reduce the
spread of most STIs, including HIV.

●

People who have an STI should tell their partner(s). Unless both partners
are treated for an STI, they will continue infecting each other. Most STIs
are curable.

Some STI symptoms:
●

A man may have pain while urinating; a discharge from his penis; or
sores, blisters, bumps or rashes on the genitals or inside the mouth.

●

A woman may have vaginal discharge that has a strange colour or bad
smell, pain or itching around the genital area, and pain or bleeding from
the vagina during or after intercourse. More severe infections can cause
fever, pain in the abdomen and infertility.

●

Many STIs in women and some in men produce no noticeable symptoms.

Not every problem in the genital area is an STI. Some infections, such as
candidiasis (yeast infection) and urinary tract infections, are not spread by
sexual intercourse. But they can cause great discomfort in the genital area.
HIV can be spread by unsterilized, contaminated needles or syringes, most
often those used for injecting drugs, and by other instruments:
An unsterilized needle or syringe can pass HIV and other infections, such as
hepatitis, from one person to another if contaminated with infected blood.
Nothing should be used to pierce a person’s skin unless it has been sterilized.
People who inject themselves with drugs or have unprotected sex with
injecting drug users are at high risk of becoming infected with HIV. People
who inject drugs should always use a clean needle and syringe. They should
never use another person’s needle or syringe.
Injections should be given only by a trained health worker using an autodisable syringe (a syringe that can be used only once).
Any kind of cut using an unsterilized object such as a razor or knife can
transmit HIV. The cutting instrument must be fully sterilized for each person,
including family members, or rinsed with bleach and/or boiling water.
Equipment for dental treatment, tattooing, facial marking, ear or body
piercing, and acupuncture is not safe unless the equipment is sterilized for
each person. The person performing the procedure should take care to avoid
any contact with blood during the procedure.

Families affected by HIV may need income support and social welfare
services to help them take care of sick family members and children. Families
should be guided and assisted in accessing these services.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Families provide the ‘ﬁrst line’ response for protecting, caring for and
supporting children infected with or affected by HIV. Families and relatives
absorb almost all the costs involved in caring for these children.
Families are generally recognized as the best source of the loving care,
protection and support that children need. Mothers, fathers or other primary
caregivers infected with HIV need support to live longer. Prolonging their
lives and keeping them healthy helps to keep a family together.
The majority of children who have lost one or both parents are living in
families that are often stretched economically and in need of support.
Caregivers tend to be female, including some who are children themselves
and many who are elderly, such as grandmothers.
Partnerships involving the government and community or non-governmental
or faith-based organizations can provide support to improve the economic
situation of families affected by HIV. Support might include access to
microcredit, low-interest bank loans and social grants.
How to access income support, such as social grants, and social welfare
services, should be clearly detailed in national guidelines. These should
be well communicated, understood and administered at the local level.
Information provided by families when applying for social grants and services
should be kept conﬁdential.
As part of the social welfare services, health-care providers should make
sure that HIV-positive children and adults from the same family can obtain
treatment and support in the same health facility. This helps conserve the
family’s time, energy and resources.
Social welfare services, with support from community and non-governmental
and faith-based organizations, should help parents and other caregivers
develop the skills needed to care for children infected with or affected by HIV.

how to prevent HIV infection and how to protect themselves and
their loved ones.

●

Empowering adolescents and youth to make decisions on when to have
or not to have sex and how to negotiate condom use
– Talking with and listening to young people is very important to
understand their situation and how best to provide them with
protection, care and support. It can sometimes be awkward for adults
to discuss sexual issues with children and adolescents. One way to
begin the discussion with school-aged children is to ask them what
they have heard about HIV and AIDS. If any of their information

Any child can be vulnerable to violations in many places, including the home. The actual
number of children experiencing violations is not easy to determine. This type of data is hard
to collect and is not updated frequently. However, it is estimated that:

CHILD PROTECTION

A family is the ﬁrst line of protection for children.
Parents or other caregivers are responsible for
building a protective and loving home environment.
Schools and communities are responsible for
building a safe and child-friendly environment
outside the child’s home. In the family, school and
community, children should be fully protected so
they can survive, grow, learn and develop to their
fullest potential.

Every child should have the opportunity to grow up in a family. If a family
is unable to care for the child, steps should be taken by the authorities to
address the reasons and make every effort to keep the family together.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Children grow best in a loving family environment in which their best
interests are always taken into account.
If a child is living without a parent or other caregiver, the authorities should
take immediate action to reunite the child with her or his own family or
extended family. But if it is determined that reuniﬁcation is not the best
option for the child, another permanent family situation should be sought.
Every effort should be made to keep siblings together.
Governments, with the support of civil society, have a responsibility to
provide appropriate and well-monitored alternative care for children without
families. Options include placement with:
●

extended family

●

a pre-screened foster family

●

a residential facility that is integrated within the community, providing
family-like care and supporting regular contact between the child and her
or his family with the aim of reuniﬁcation, if it is in the best interest of
the child.

Children should be involved in decisions on their placement in alternative
living situations.

152 Facts for Life

Very often children placed in institutions could be raised in a family with
the proper social support. While some orphanages are well managed,
institutional life can be detrimental to children’s development. It typically
separates them from family and community life and offers less protection
from abuse and exploitation.
Any form of institutional care should be considered a last resort and a
temporary solution.
KEY MESSAGE

Every child has a right to a name and nationality. Registering a child’s birth
helps to ensure a child’s right to education, health care and legal and social
services. Birth registration is a vital step towards protection from abuse
and exploitation.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Registering a child’s birth is a vital step towards her or his protection. Children
under age 5 with a birth certiﬁcate are more likely to be immunized and
receive health care for childhood illnesses, assuring them a healthy start
in life.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Birth registration provides an ofﬁcial record of a child’s existence and
nationality. It is considered a fundamental human right. A child without a birth
certiﬁcate can be denied health care, legal services, access to school and the
right to vote upon reaching adulthood.

CHILD PROTECTION

2.

Any enforcement of minimum-age legislation depends upon an ofﬁcial
record of a child’s age. For example, a birth certiﬁcate can be used to protect
a child from illegal recruitment by armed forces or armed groups, from child
marriage or from hazardous forms of work.

The birth registration process may be supported by social services, such as
health care and education. Health centres and hospitals sometimes have civil
registrars on site that can provide a child’s birth certiﬁcate at birth or during
a health-care visit. Registration sometimes takes place in early childhood
education programmes.

BREASTFEEDING

Birth registration should be free and accessible for every child. Where it is
not, civil society organizations can sometimes assist families in registering
their children.

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Girls and boys can encounter different forms of violence, abuse and/or
harmful practices in many settings:
In the family and home:
●

physical violence

●

psychological violence

●

sexual violence and abuse

●

corporal (physical) punishment

●

neglect and abandonment

●

child marriage

●

harmful traditional practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting
(FGM/C).

In schools and other educational activities:
●

corporal punishment

●

psychological punishment

●

sexual and gender-based violence

●

verbal and physical bullying

●

ﬁghting.

In care and justice institutions (e.g., orphanages, children’s homes and

●

physical and psychological violence under the guise of discipline

●

●

child-on-child violence

●

sexual abuse and violence.

In workplaces:

●

sexual harassment and abuse.

In the community (among peers, between gangs, by the police and
by trafﬁckers):
●

physical violence

●

armed violence

●

sexual violence.

154 Facts for Life

Children who experience or witness violence often remain silent out of
fear, shame or stigma. Some accept it as part of life. While some violence is
perpetrated by strangers, most is carried out by people children know and
should be able to trust and look to for protection. These may include parents,
step-parents or a parent’s partner, relatives, caregivers, boyfriends and
girlfriends, schoolmates, teachers, religious leaders and employers.
All girls and boys can be subjects of abuse. Generally, boys tend to be at
greater risk of physical and armed violence and girls face greater risk of
neglect and sexual violence and exploitation.

Typically, the focus is on intervention after child maltreatment occurs. Due
to the magnitude of the problem, it is critical that communities shift the
emphasis to preventing child violence, abuse, neglect and harmful practices.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Babies and young children are sometimes the object of a parent’s or other
caregiver’s anger or frustration, often when children do not stop crying.
The caregiver may shake the baby or young child so hard and violently
that it causes injury to the child’s brain that can lead to permanent injury or
death. It is never okay to shake a child. Symptoms of violent shaking include
irritability, difﬁculty staying awake, difﬁculty breathing, shakiness, vomiting,
seizures or coma. These symptoms require immediate medical care.

CHILD PROTECTION

Certain groups of children are particularly vulnerable to violence. These
include children with disabilities, children of minority groups, children living
or working on the street, children in conﬂict with the law, and children who
are refugees, displaced or migrating.

Every community should create and implement a plan of action to eliminate
violence against children.
Some key actions may include:

●

educate parents and caregivers to respect the child’s perspective, learn
how to use positive and non-violent discipline and not to discipline a child
when angry

●

support schools to nurture attitudes that reject violence and promote
non-violent conﬂict resolution. This can involve changing classroom
management (traditionally based on fear, threats, humiliation and physical
punishment) to a child-friendly approach that is non-discriminatory and
supports cooperative learning

●

sponsor public campaigns to stop corporal punishment, abuse and
harmful practices such as child marriage and genital mutilation/cutting

●

provide children affected by violence with health and social services to
help them reintegrate into their families and communities

●

establish safe ways for children to report violence against them, such as

Children must be protected from all work that is hazardous. Work should not
prevent them from attending school. Children should never be involved in the
worst forms of child labour, such as slavery, forced labour, drug production
or trafﬁcking.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Children who work often do so to support their families’ livelihood so they
can eat and have basic necessities. Many children begin working at an early
age, as young as 4 years old. In many cases, it is considered normal for
children to work long hours before or after school, or to work all day and
evening and not attend school at all.
Children can be found working in agriculture, commerce, factories, ﬁshing,
markets, housekeeping, childcare, handicrafts, restaurants, garbage dumps
and in the streets.
Close to 70 per cent of working children work in agriculture, which can be
extremely hazardous. It can involve heavy manual labour, long hours, and the
use of pesticides and dangerous tools. Children can be at risk of sexual abuse
and exploitation, especially during harvesting season (when they often work
extra-long hours) and while working on plantations.
Some children are engaged in the worst forms of child labour, such as child
slavery, debt bondage, forced labour, drug production and trafﬁcking. These
are illegal. Children must be removed immediately from such situations and,
if it is in their best interest, reintegrated into their families and communities.
The work children do should not be hazardous to their health or well-being. It
should not prevent children from going to school.
The government and local authorities, with support from families and civil
society, should develop measures to address harmful child labour situations,
such as:
●

identifying and communicating to the general public the different forms
of harmful child labour found in the community and the forms children
might encounter if they migrate

●

identifying and removing children from harmful child labour

●

helping children removed from harmful child labour who live away from
their families to reintegrate into their family and community, if it is in their
best interest

●

ensuring that all children in the community attend a child-friendly school
full-time and receive an education that is of good quality, equal for all
children and free from violence

156 Facts for Life

●

providing income support and/or social welfare services to families who
need them, so they are less reliant on their children’s income and can
send them to school.

Families need to know the risks involved in sending their children away for

Children and adolescents should be well informed about the dangers of
leaving home and taking work that might land them in high-risk situations
such as prostitution and drug trafﬁcking.

CHILD PROTECTION

KEY MESSAGE

SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Most children who are sexually abused know their abusers. Most abusers
are relatives or acquaintances of the child. A much smaller percentage of
offenders are strangers. Most child sexual abuse is committed by men.
Whatever the case, sexual abuse or exploitation is never the child’s fault.
The responsibility always lies with the abuser.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Children need to be protected from all forms of sexual exploitation and
sexual abuse.

Every person has a unique reaction to sexual abuse or sexual exploitation,
regardless of the type, extent or duration. Victims may show a range of
emotional responses such as calm, anger, indifference or shock.

Many children and young people who have been victims of sexual abuse or
exploitation heal and go on to lead normal lives. Sexual abuse in childhood
does not automatically lead to sexually aggressive behaviour. Most sexual

Children can also be taught to tell an adult they trust if they have experienced
a ‘bad’ touch. If a child comes to an adult with such information, the adult
must take the child’s claims seriously and immediately ensure that the abuse
stops. The abuse should be reported to the authorities, and the child should
receive protection services.

are sexually abused do not abuse others.
Governments are responsible for ensuring that systems and speciﬁc
measures are in place to:
●

prevent child abuse, violence and exploitation

●

enable children to report abuse and exploitation

●

make sure perpetrators of sexual abuse and exploitation are dealt with to
the full extent of the law

Children are vulnerable to trafﬁcking where protection for children is weak
or missing. The government, civil society and families are responsible
for preventing trafﬁcking, as well as helping children who are victims to
reintegrate into their families and communities, if it is in their best interest.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Trafﬁcking of children is one of the fastest growing transnational crimes,
occurring in and between countries. Proﬁt from human trafﬁcking has been
estimated at approximately US$9.5 billion annually.
Children who are trafﬁcked are:
●

treated as commodities

●

subject to violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation and HIV infection.

It is calculated that the majority of the children trafﬁcked every year are girls
who are sexually exploited.
Children and families burdened by poverty and with limited access to
information may leave their communities because they believe better
opportunities await them elsewhere. Sometimes children are promised a
good education, a well-paying job or a better life. Instead they may ﬁnd
themselves smuggled or moved across borders or taken within their own
country by trafﬁckers and forced into dangerous situations. These may
include domestic servitude, prostitution, forced marriage or begging.
It is important for children and families choosing to leave their communities
to understand where they are going. They should know:
●

what they can expect

●

potential risks involved during travel as well as at the destination

●

what to do if they get into a trafﬁcking situation.

158 Facts for Life

Governments can support local authorities and civil society to:
distribute information to parents and children on the risks of migration

that are sensitive to children should be put in place for children who are
victims or witnesses of crime.

Placing children who have committed crimes or have been accused of
committing crimes in a detention centre, prison or reform school or any other
closed setting should always be a last resort. Detention can be detrimental to
children’s development and make reintegration into society more difﬁcult.

Children can remain in detention for months or years awaiting review of their
case. These children are at higher risk of violence and exposure to drugs, HIV
infection and other health problems. Detention can interrupt their schooling
and distance them from family. Children in detention generally need a social
protection response, not a judicial one.
Supporting Information 159

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

The majority of children in detention have not committed a serious offence.
They are often detained for dropping out of school, running away from home,
using alcohol, begging or vagrancy. Some children are in detention because
they have been exploited by adults through prostitution or drug dealing.

BREASTFEEDING

Alternatives such as mediation, community service and counselling
produce better results for children and their families and communities.
Such alternatives are generally more respectful of children’s rights and help
children learn how to take on a more constructive role in society. This should
be the objective of all justice interventions concerning children.

Children who are in detention should:
●

be separated from adult offenders

●

have their cases addressed within a short time frame

●

be separated by gender

●

have appropriate means to report violence committed against them while
in detention.

Pregnant women and mothers with children in detention need special
protection, care and support. All children in these circumstances are entitled
to protection of their rights, such as access to health care and education.
Child-sensitive procedures for boys and girls should be put in place for child
victims and witnesses of crime. Such procedures should:
●

prevent contact between the child and the alleged perpetrator (the person
who is accused of committing the crime)

●

allow for the child’s full participation in the justice process

●

ensure that the child is treated with dignity and compassion.

Burns can be prevented by keeping children away from ﬁres, cooking stoves,
hot liquids and foods, and exposed electric wires.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Burning and scalding are among the most common causes of serious injury
among young children. Burns often cause permanent scarring, and some are
fatal. The great majority of these are preventable.

keep young children away from cooking ﬁres, matches, parafﬁn lamps,
candles and ﬂammable liquids such as parafﬁn and kerosene

●

put stoves on a ﬂat, raised surface out of the reach of children

●

if an open cooking ﬁre is used, make it on a raised mound of clay, not
directly on the ground. A barrier of mud, bamboo or other material or
a playpen can also be used to keep young children out of reach of the
cooking place.

●

do not leave small children alone near ﬁres or to tend ﬁres or cook

●

keep children away from heaters, hot irons and other hot appliances

●

never leave a child alone in a room with a candle or ﬁre burning.

Another major cause of burns is scalding from hot liquids or foods. To
prevent scalds:
turn the handles of all cooking pots away from the reach of children

●

keep hot foods and liquids in a safe place and out of children’s reach

●

do not let children turn on the hot water tap in a bath or shower by
themselves

●

keep the temperature of water heaters below a medium setting to prevent
scalding if children turn on the hot water

●

teach children not to play rough around people with hot drinks or in the
kitchen when meals are being prepared

●

never hold a child when having hot liquids or foods.

●

teach children never to put their ﬁngers or other objects into electric
sockets

●

cover power sockets to prevent access

Falls are a major cause of injury for young children. Stairs, balconies, roofs,
windows, and play and sleeping areas should be made secure, using barriers
with vertical bars to protect children from falling.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Children often fall as they learn to walk, run and jump. Many of these falls
cause small scrapes and bruises. Sometimes falls can cause broken bones,
head injuries or other serious injuries, even death.
Infants left unattended may fall from beds, cots or hammocks. Young children
may fall down stairs or from windows or balconies.
Children like to climb. They can be seriously injured if they fall from a high
place or try to climb up on top of heavy furniture that might fall on them.
In addition to supervision, some steps to prevent children from serious
falls include:
●

discourage and prevent children from climbing onto unsafe places

●

do not allow children to play on stairs and balconies, and, if they do,
watch them closely

●

use railings of appropriate width and height with vertical bars on stairs,
windows or balconies

●

keep the home clean, well lit and free of sharp objects and rough edges

●

properly secure babies in high chairs

●

do not leave infants unattended on beds, cots, hammocks or in walkers or
other baby equipment

●

keep furniture such as beds, chairs and cribs away from windows

●

do not put toys or other items on high shelves that may attract small
children, and fasten heavy furniture such as cabinets or shelves to
the wall.

Medicines, poisons, insecticides, bleach, acids and liquid fertilizers and
fuels, such as parafﬁn (kerosene), should be stored carefully out of children’s
sight and reach. Dangerous substances should be stored in clearly marked
containers and never in drinking bottles. Child-resistant closures, where
available, should be used on the containers of poisonous products.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Many poisons can kill, cause brain damage, blind or permanently injure
if they:
are swallowed

●

are inhaled

●

get onto the skin

●

get into the eyes.

The key to preventing poisoning is to keep harmful substances out of
children’s reach.

●

Detergents, bleaches, chemicals and medicines should never be left where
children can reach them. They should be tightly sealed and labelled. They
should also be locked in a cupboard or trunk or put on a high shelf where
children cannot see or reach them.

●

Medicines meant for adults can kill or injure small children. Medicine
should only be given to a child if it is prescribed for that child. It should
never be given to a child if it is prescribed for an adult or some other
child. A child should never take medication on his or her own. The parent
or other caregiver should give the medication to the child each time it is
needed. Medication should be stored out of reach and sight of children.

Knives, scissors, sharp or pointed objects and broken glass can cause serious
injuries. These objects should be kept out of children’s reach. Plastic bags,
which can cause suffocation, should be kept away from young children.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Broken glass can cause serious cuts, loss of blood and infected wounds.
Sharp metal objects, machinery and rusty cans can cause wounds that can
become badly infected.
Families can reduce the risk of children’s injuries from glass and sharp objects
if they:
●

Young children like to put things in their mouths. To prevent choking, small
objects, such as coins, nuts and buttons, should be kept out of their reach.
Children’s foods should be cut into small pieces that can be easily chewed
and swallowed.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Parents or other caregivers should:
keep play and sleeping areas free of small objects such as buttons, beads,
balloons, pen caps, coins, seeds and nuts

●

check new toys carefully before children play with them to make sure they
have no loose or sharp pieces that could break and be swallowed by or
hurt the child

●

never give young children foods they can choke on such as groundnuts
(peanuts), hard sweets or food with small bones or seeds

●

always supervise young children during meals, and cut or tear children’s
food into small pieces that can be easily chewed or swallowed.

Coughing, gagging and high-pitched, noisy breathing or the inability to
make any sound at all indicate breathing difﬁculty and possible choking.
Parents and other caregivers should suspect a child is choking when he or
she suddenly has trouble breathing, even if no one has seen the child put
something into the mouth.

FIRST AID ADVICE
Until medical help is available, the following ﬁrst aid measures should help prevent a
situation from becoming worse. Parents, other caregivers and older children should be
supported in learning about these ﬁrst aid measures.

First aid for burns:

●

If the child's clothing catches ﬁre, quickly wrap the child
in a blanket or clothing or roll him or her on the ground
to put out the ﬁre.

For minor burns, the
following steps can
be taken:

●

Cool the burned area immediately. Use plenty of cold,
clean water, which helps to reduce pain and swelling. Do
not put ice on the burn; this can further damage the skin.

●

Keep the burn clean and dry with a loose sterile gauze
bandage or clean cloth. This will protect blistered skin.

●

Do not break blisters, as they protect the injured area.
If a blister is broken, the area is more susceptible to
infection. Do not apply butter or ointments to the burn;
they can prevent proper healing.

●

A minor burn will usually heal without further treatment.

●

Do not remove the burned clothing from the body.
Make sure the child is no longer near any burning or
smouldering materials or exposed to smoke or heat.

●

Do not immerse large, serious burns in cold water, as
this could cause shock.

●

Raise the burned body part or parts above heart level, if
possible.

●

Loosely cover the burn area with cool, moist towels or
cloths or a sterile bandage.

●

If the child is unconscious, keep him or her warm. Roll
the child onto his or her side so that the tongue does not
block breathing.

●

Check for signs of breathing, movement and coughing.
If there are no signs, follow the steps under ‘First aid for
breathing problems or drowning’.

For major burns that
burn all layers of skin,
emergency care is needed
immediately. Until it is
available, the following
steps can be taken:

174 Facts for Life

First aid for broken bones,
bruises or sprains:

A child who is unable to move or is in extreme pain may
have broken bones. Do not move the injured area and
get medical help immediately.

●

For bad bruises and sprains, immerse the injured area
in cold water or put ice on the injury for 15 minutes. Do
not put the ice directly on the skin; use a layer of cloth
between the ice and the skin. Remove the ice or water,
wait 15 minutes and repeat, if necessary. The cold should
help reduce pain, swelling and bruising.

For minor cuts and wounds:
●

Wash the wound with clean (or boiled and cooled) water
and soap.

●

Dry the skin around the wound.

●

Cover the wound with a clean cloth and place a sterile
bandage over it.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

First aid for cuts
and wounds:

●

For serious cuts and wounds:

●

If the child is bleeding heavily, raise the injured area
above the level of the chest and press ﬁrmly against the
wound (or near it if something is stuck in it) with a pad
made of folded clean cloth. Maintain pressure until the
bleeding stops.

●

Do not put any plant or animal matter on the wound, as
this could cause infection.

●

Put a clean sterile bandage on the wound. Allow for
swelling by not tying the bandage too tightly.

●

Seek medical help immediately. Ask a trained health
worker if the child should have a tetanus injection.

BREASTFEEDING

If a piece of glass or other object is sticking in the
wound, do not remove it. It may be preventing further
bleeding, and removing it could make the injury worse.

If the object is still lodged in the child’s throat:

For infants or young children:
●

Support the head and neck.

●

Turn the baby or young child face down with the head
lower than the feet. Deliver ﬁve careful blows to the back
between the shoulder blades. Turn the baby face up and
press ﬁrmly on the breastbone between the nipples ﬁve
times. Repeat (face down and face up) until the object
is dislodged.

●

If you cannot dislodge the object, take the child to the
nearest health worker immediately.

For larger children:

176 Facts for Life

●

Stand behind the child with your arms around the
child’s waist.

●

Form a clenched ﬁst with your thumb against the child’s
body, above the navel and below the rib cage.

●

Put the other hand over the ﬁst and give a sharp inward
and upward thrust into the child’s abdomen. Repeat until
the object is dislodged.

●

If you cannot dislodge the object, take the child to the
nearest health worker immediately.

First aid for breathing
problems or drowning:

If the child is having difﬁculty breathing or is not
breathing, lay the child ﬂat on the back and tilt her or his
head back slightly. Pinch the child’s nostrils closed and
blow (breathe) into the mouth, keeping all the mouth
covered. Blow gently but hard enough to make the
child’s chest rise. Then, count to three and blow again.
Continue until the child begins breathing.

●

If the child is breathing but unconscious, roll the
child onto his or her side so the tongue does not
block breathing.

●

If a person who cannot swim sees a child drowning
in deep water, the person should immediately throw
a rope, ﬂoating device or tree branch to the child and
shout loudly so that others can come to help rescue
the child.

●

If a child has swallowed poison, do not try to make the
child vomit. This may make the child more ill.

●

If poison is on the child’s skin or clothes, remove the
clothing and pour large amounts of water over the skin.
Wash the skin thoroughly several times with soap.

●

If a child gets poison in his or her eyes, splash clean
water in the eyes for at least 10 minutes.

●

Take the child immediately to a health centre or hospital
if any of these situations occur. If possible, bring a
sample of the poison or medicine or its container with
you. Keep the child as still and quiet as possible.

●

If a child is bitten by a venomous or rabid animal, it is
important to see a health-care provider immediately
for treatment.

mergencies, such as conﬂicts, disasters
or epidemics, expose families to risks
that make them especially vulnerable to
disease, malnutrition and violence. With the right
information and support, families and communities
can establish measures that map out what to do in
an emergency.

Displacement undermines families’ livelihoods and social support mechanisms. This can
lead to family separations and increase children’s vulnerability to discrimination, abuse,
violence, poverty and exploitation.

In situations of conﬂict, girls and boys are particularly vulnerable to forced recruitment by
armed forces and groups. Along with women, they are also at risk of abduction, trafﬁcking
and sexual violence, including rape.

A pandemic is a widespread, usually global, epidemic. An inﬂuenza pandemic results from
a new inﬂuenza virus against which the population has little or no immunity. It can spread
rapidly across the world and is recurrent and unpredictable. The youngest children, under
2 years of age, are particularly vulnerable to inﬂuenza and other infectious diseases.
Children and their family members have the right to protection and the information and
support they may need to prepare for and cope with such complex situations.

EMERGENCIES: PREPAREDNESS
AND RESPONSE

Epidemics (or outbreaks) of diseases can be caused by emergencies or can by themselves
cause an emergency. The emergency can arise because of the severe nature of the disease
or the community’s response to it.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Conﬂict and disasters put children at risk of disease and malnutrition. Access to health
services is reduced, and food shortages are common. Water can become scarce, especially
when access is limited by overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions. Children’s access
to education is often undermined, since schools are frequently targeted for attacks and
abductions, and teachers and materials are in short supply. The risk of HIV transmission
increases in such contexts.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Girls, boys and women typically are the most
affected by emergencies. An estimated 26 million
people were displaced by armed conﬂicts and
violence in 2007. Each year, up to 50 million people
are displaced due to disasters. Climate change
could increase these numbers.

KEY MESSAGE

1.

In emergencies, children have the same rights as in non-emergency
situations. This is true whether the emergency is a conﬂict, disaster
or epidemic.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

All children and their families and communities have the right to receive
humanitarian assistance in emergencies.
Children and their families who are forced from their homes by conﬂicts
or disasters have the same rights as those living in their homes and
communities in non-emergency situations.
Communities can designate protected areas to shelter civilians and the sick.
These areas must never be used for any military purposes.
Humanitarian relief workers and supplies must always be respected
and protected. Combatants should always allow all civilians access to
humanitarian assistance.
The particular needs of women and adolescent girls in emergency situations
must be respected. Their speciﬁc needs of privacy, hygiene and protection
must be taken into account. Unaccompanied children, pregnant women,
mothers with young children, female heads-of-households, persons with
disabilities and the elderly may require speciﬁc attention to address their
particular needs.

182 Facts for Life

When children and families are displaced within a country, the national
authorities have the primary responsibility to protect children’s rights
and assist children and families. The United Nations, non-governmental
organizations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),
among others, also have a critical role to play in providing assistance and
protection to children and families.

As communities begin to re-establish and reconstruct after an emergency,
attention should be given to providing social services, including health and
education, to children, women and families.
Humanitarian workers who provide aid to civilians should minimize
opportunities for violence, exploitation and abuse. Any activity by
humanitarian workers that exploits the population should be reported
immediately to the agency concerned and the authorities.

2.

Girls and boys and their families and communities should plan ahead and
take simple steps to prepare for emergencies – at home, at school and in
the community.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

The possible dangers and safe areas in and around a community should be
identiﬁed. If possible they should be shown on a local map. Everybody in
the community should be involved and informed. Plans should include how
young children, older people and people who are unwell would be assisted.

Supporting Information 183

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Community warning systems and evacuation routes for escaping from
danger should be well identiﬁed and communicated. Communities can hold
simulated drills of safety measures with boys and girls in schools and with
families in neighbourhoods.

EMERGENCIES: PREPAREDNESS
AND RESPONSE

Within the household, the whole family can prepare for an emergency
brought about by a disaster or conﬂict. Everyone should be aware of the
different dangers of ﬁre, earthquakes, ﬂoods, storms and other hazards
and the risks during conﬂicts. The response can be more effective when
everyone in the family and community knows how to reduce their risks and
understands their responsibilities.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Displaced persons have the right to safely return to their homes as soon as
the reasons for their displacement are no longer an issue. The property rights
of displaced persons must be respected so children and families can rebuild
their lives.

Communities should ensure that health facilities are well built to withstand
emergencies and function in their wake. Health-care staff must be trained so
they are prepared to act in emergency situations.
It is important for schools to be located in a safe place, close to where
children live and away from disaster-prone areas, such as where ﬂooding or
mudslides might occur. Schools should be well constructed to ensure the
safety of children and teachers. They should be carefully organized to protect
children from attacks, abduction or other forms of violence.
Teachers and school administrators can help children, their families and
communities to:
●

understand natural hazards and other emergency risks

●

know how to prevent disaster

●

know what to do in an emergency.

Families, including children, should be encouraged to recognize a warning
and understand what to do when they see or hear it. A warning or signal can
be as simple as a whistle, horn or coloured ﬂag. Safe locations where families
can meet should be identiﬁed. Safe places for domestic animals should also
be identiﬁed. These precautions help to prevent family separation.
Children can be trained to memorize their name and the names of
their relatives and their village or town. They can be trained to identify
geographical indicators or landmarks that might locate their community if
they get separated from their families.
A family emergency bag prepared in advance can be life-saving. It should
include a torch (ﬂashlight), batteries, candles, matches, radio, water container
and ﬁrst aid kit. The packet should be checked periodically and ready at
all times.
Birth certiﬁcates and other important family documents should be kept in a
safe, easily accessible place. Storing them in plastic wrap helps protect them
from water and damage.

An epidemic (or outbreak) of disease can cause an emergency because of the
severity of the disease or responses to it. In the case of pandemic inﬂuenza
and other diseases spread by close personal contact, those who are ill should
be kept separated from others.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

The impact of a disease outbreak depends on the severity of the disease as
well as the responses by governments, communities and individuals.
An inﬂuenza pandemic, involving a new virus, can spread rapidly through a
population that has little or no immunity against the new virus. The inﬂuenza
might be moderate or severe in terms of the illness and death it causes. The
outbreak can come and go repeatedly over time. Its level of severity can
change over the course of the pandemic, making it unpredictable. It generally
has a greater impact than regular seasonal inﬂuenza outbreaks.
Annual or seasonal inﬂuenza causes most deaths in people over 65 years
of age. An inﬂuenza pandemic causes more severe illness and deaths in
younger age groups. In both seasonal and pandemic inﬂuenza, pregnant
women and children under 2 years old are at increased risk of complications
and death. Older children have the highest rates of infection but tend not to
have severe outcomes.
Inﬂuenza symptoms include high fever, cough, sore throat, body aches,
headache, chills, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhoea. In some cases, inﬂuenza
can lead to pneumonia and breathing difﬁculties.
During an outbreak of inﬂuenza or other infection, some general steps to help
protect children and families include:
●

stay home if sick, and stay apart from others

●

know the symptoms and danger signs, and what to do and where to go to
get help if the illness becomes severe

●

wash hands with soap and water often, and keep surfaces clean

●

cough or sneeze into an elbow or a tissue, and dispose safely of tissues

●

do not spit near children or in public.

In an outbreak of an infection that has serious consequences, it is important
to reduce close contact with others:
●

stay at least one metre apart from others, especially if they are coughing
or sneezing or look unwell

●

stay at home as much as possible and avoid public gatherings and travel.

186 Facts for Life

In an extensive outbreak, some individuals may need to be isolated in a
hospital setting for treatment or to prevent the spread of the infection. But for
many people access to care may be limited.
To care for sick people at home and to prevent the spread of the infection in
the household:
●

give sick people a separate space at home

●

assign a single caregiver to a sick person

●

give plenty of ﬂuids and foods to the sick person.

In some cases breastfeeding is not possible. These include children
temporarily or permanently separated from their mothers, mothers who are
very sick, mothers who have stopped breastfeeding for some time, mothers
who have not been able to restart breastfeeding, and HIV-positive mothers
who have chosen not to breastfeed.

In these situations, for children under 12 months, the most appropriate food
is a high-quality breastmilk substitute (infant formula). Safe preparaton of the

Stress can temporarily interfere with the ﬂow of breastmilk. But it does not
need to stop breastmilk production, if mothers and infants remain together
and are supported in initiating and continuing breastfeeding. Safe havens, as
in refugee camps and shelters, can be established where women can go to
receive support.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

People often believe that during emergencies many mothers can no longer
breastfeed due to stress or inadequate nutrition. This is a misconception –
it is not correct. Mothers who lack food or who are undernourished can
still breastfeed adequately. They should be given extra ﬂuids and foods to
protect their health and well-being and that of the child. Fathers and other
family members can support breastfeeding mothers with food preparation
and childcare.

Breastmilk substitutes should never be distributed in an uncontrolled manner
alongside food aid and without attention to the conditions required for safe
preparation. They should not displace breastfeeding, a baby’s best protection
against illness in an emergency situation.
KEY MESSAGE

6.

Children have the right to be protected from violence in emergencies.
Governments, civil society, international organizations, communities and
families have the responsibility to protect them.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Protecting girls and boys during conﬂicts or disasters is critical since they can
be vulnerable to many kinds of violence.
Some violence is directly related to the emergency. This includes abduction,
torture, beating, harassment and injuries during ﬁghting by soldiers or armed
groups or ﬁghting in communities over limited resources. Emergencies
also increase the usual risks of violence in a community, such as domestic
violence, violence in schools or violence among children themselves.
Girls and women are at particular risk of trafﬁcking and sexual violence,
including rape, which is sometimes used as a tactic of war. This is
unacceptable. All efforts should be taken by governments and local
authorities to make sure this never happens. Girls and women who are
subjected to this violence need health care, psychosocial support and
counselling. Some will need support in relocating and reintegrating into
their families.
In armed conﬂicts, children must be protected. They must not be recruited
by armed forces or armed groups or be allowed to take part in ﬁghting.
If children are arrested, they should not be harmed. They should be kept
separate from adults (or with their family), and they must receive a fair trial.
If girls or boys are victims of violence, they have the right to seek justice that
takes their views into account.
It is important for children and families to report violations against children’s
rights to the authorities when it is safe to do so. Serious violations of
children’s rights, including killing children, using children as soldiers, sexual
violence against children and abduction of children, should be reported to
international humanitarian agencies.

7.

It is generally preferable for children to be cared for by their parents or other
usual caregivers because it makes children feel more secure. If separation
occurs, every effort should be made to reunite the child with his or her family,
if it is in the child’s best interest.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

In emergencies, it is the duty of the government or the authorities in charge to
ensure that children are not separated from their parents or other caregivers.

Every effort should then be made to ﬁnd the child’s family and to reunite the
child with his or her family, if it is in the best interest of the child.

If a child is temporarily placed in a foster family, it is the duty of those
responsible for the placement to follow up on the child’s care and well-being.
They should also ensure that the foster family is provided with the means to
adequately care for the child.

Long-term care arrangements should not be made during an emergency.
After a suitable period of investigation, if parents or relatives cannot be
traced or are not available to care for the child, a foster family or domestic
adoptive family, preferably in the child’s community, should be found for the
child. Childcare institutions or orphanages should always be considered a
temporary measure and a last resort.

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

A move to a new community or country can be stressful, especially if the
child’s family has ﬂed violence or a disaster. Displaced children sometimes
may have to learn a new language and culture. Often, schools and community
organizations can assist children and their families with the transition and
integration into their new community.

EMERGENCIES: PREPAREDNESS
AND RESPONSE

Children who have become separated from their parents in an emergency
cannot be assumed to be orphans. They are not available for adoption. As
long as the fate of a child’s parents and/or other close relatives cannot be
determined, each separated child must be assumed to have parents and/or
close relatives who are still living.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT
AND EARLY LEARNING

Interim care must be provided for children separated from their families.
Where possible this can be provided by the child’s extended family or by a
family from the child’s community until the child is reunited with parents or
relatives or placed with a foster family. Every effort should be made to keep
siblings together.

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

If separation occurs, the government or authorities in charge have the
responsibility to provide special protection and care for these children. They
should ﬁrst register all unaccompanied, separated and orphaned children and
make sure their essential needs are met.

KEY MESSAGE

8.

The disruption and stress caused by disasters and armed conﬂict can frighten
and anger children. When such events occur, children need special attention
and extra affection. They should be kept as safe as possible and supported
in resuming normal activities. Children can be given age-appropriate
opportunities to participate in the responses to and decisions regarding the
emergency situation.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

It is normal for children’s feelings and behaviours to be affected by
frightening, painful or violent experiences. Children react differently – they
may lose interest in daily life, become more aggressive or turn very fearful.
Some children who appear to be coping well are hiding their emotions
and fears.
Parents or regular caregivers, peers, teachers and community members
are an important source of support and security for children. Families and
communities can help children if they:
●

listen to both girls and boys and provide them opportunities to express
their concerns, participate in decision-making and ﬁnd solutions

●

provide children with age-appropriate information, reassurance and
emotional support

●

maintain familiar routines in daily life and resume normal activities as
soon as possible

●

provide enjoyable age-appropriate activities for children such as cultural
activities, visits to friends and families, and sports

●

encourage children to continue to play and socialize with others

●

provide children with age-appropriate opportunities to participate in
meaningful ways in everyday activities and in the emergency response,
such as assisting with teaching and caring for young children

●

maintain clear rules for acceptable behaviour and avoid physical
punishment

●

provide safe spaces where children and parents can socialize, learn life
skills and access basic services

●

help children learn how to manage their stress.

When children’s stress reactions are severe and last for a long time, they
need help from a qualiﬁed professional such as a counsellor, psychologist or
specialized nurse or doctor.

Children have the right to education, even during emergencies. Having
children attend a safe, child-friendly school helps to reinforce their sense of
normalcy and start the process of healing.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Regular routines, such as going to school and maintaining normal eating and
sleeping schedules, give children a sense of security and continuity.

With support from families and communities, teachers and school
administrators can help:

●

identify children who are experiencing stress, trauma or family separation
and provide basic psychosocial support

●

provide a daily routine and a sense of the future beyond the emergency

●

ensure that children retain and develop basic literacy and numeracy skills

●

provide children with life-saving health and security information and skills
to reduce their risks

●

provide a place for expression through play, sports, music, drama and art

●

facilitate integration of vulnerable children into the school and community

●

support networking and interaction with and among families

●

provide children with an understanding of human rights and skills for
living in peace

●

build awareness with children on how to protect the environment and
develop their skills to reduce disaster risks

●

encourage children to analyse information, express opinions and take
action on particular issues important to them.

Teachers require support and training to understand and deal with children’s
and their own stressful experiences, losses and reactions to emergencies.
They need to know how to give emotional, mental and spiritual support to
students and guide families on how to do the same with their children.

Supporting Information 191

NUTRITION AND GROWTH

Schools and communities can also help to organize fun activities for children
outside of school time. Opportunities can be created for organized non-violent
play, sports and other forms of recreation. Communication and interaction
among peers should be encouraged and supported. Use of arts such as

SAFE MOTHERHOOD

Child-friendly schools and spaces can provide a protective and safe learning
environment for all children coping with an emergency.

drawing, or playing with toys or puppets, can help young children express
their concerns and adjust to stressful experiences.
Parents and other caregivers should keep children who become sick with
the ﬂu or other infectious disease at home or in their place of residence if
displaced from their homes.
In case of a severe epidemic that spreads rapidly from person to person, local
authorities and education personnel need to make appropriate decisions
regarding how to protect children. As a public health measure, classes may
be suspended to reduce spread of the disease. In such cases, education can
still continue by using alternative strategies. This requires good planning and
follow-up by education personnel in collaboration with the students’ families.
KEY MESSAGE

10.

Landmines and unexploded devices are extremely dangerous. They can
explode and kill or disable many people if touched, stepped on or disturbed
in any way. Children and their families should stay only in areas that have
been declared safe and avoid unknown objects.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Landmines are victim-activated explosive devices intended to kill or injure
people or destroy or damage vehicles. Unexploded ordnance (called UXO)
are any munitions, such as bombs, shells, mortars or grenades, that were
used but failed to detonate as intended.
Both landmines and UXO come in many different shapes, sizes and colours.
They can be buried underground, placed above ground or hidden in grass,
trees or water. They may be bright and shiny or dirty and rusty, but they are
always dangerous and must be avoided at all times.
Landmines are usually not visible. Special caution is needed near areas of
military action or abandoned or overgrown areas. Dangerous areas are often
designated by a marking such as a picture of a skull and crossbones, redpainted stones or other common markings that draw attention and are easily
recognized as hazard warnings by the local population.
UXO are often easier to see than landmines. Their colour and shape make
them attractive to children, but they are extremely dangerous and unstable.
They can explode with the slightest touch or change in temperature. They kill
more often than do landmines.
Children should be taught not to touch unfamiliar objects. They need to learn
that if anything looks suspicious they should keep away and inform adults
they know or the authorities.

192 Facts for Life

Since some roads may be mined or littered with explosive remnants of war, it
is important for families to ask local people which roads or paths are safe to
travel. Generally it is safer to travel on commonly used roads and paths.
Places likely to have mines, UXO or abandoned weapons and ammunition
include abandoned or destroyed buildings, unused paths or roads, untouched
and overgrown ﬁelds, current or former military bases, outposts, checkpoints,
trenches or ditches. Children and their families need to be informed to stay
away from these areas. Measures should be put in place to keep them away.

●

stand still and tell others nearby to do the same

●

avoid panicking

●

avoid movement

●

call for help

●

if help does not come, carefully consider the options before moving to
retrace the original steps backwards very slowly.

apply ﬁrm pressure to the bleeding area until the bleeding stops

●

if the bleeding is not stopping, tie a cloth or piece of clothing (a
tourniquet) just above or as close to the wound as possible and send for
medical assistance

●

if help is delayed more than one hour, loosen the tourniquet hourly to
check the bleeding; remove the tourniquet when the bleeding stops

●

if the person is breathing but unconscious, roll the person onto his or her
side so the tongue does not block breathing

●

seek follow-up medical care, as needed.

Governments and local authorities have the responsibility to make
communities safe for all children and families. Professional demining is the
best solution to ensure the safety of all.
