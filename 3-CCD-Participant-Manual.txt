Participant Manual

Introduction
Children need good care. Their survival through childhood depends on adults who notice when
they are hungry or sick, and are able to meet their needs.
Good care also means keeping children safe from harm, and giving them love, attention, and
many opportunities to learn. From birth, children build ties to special adults and look to them to
learn important skills. What children learn from these relationships helps to prepare them for life.
This course on Counsel the Family on Care for Child Development supports the
efforts of families and others in your community who are trying to raise healthy,
happy children. They may live in poverty and face many other challenges. The
children they raise may be their own. Or they may have accepted the task of raising
other children in their family or community. You can help them be better able to
care for their children, even under difficult conditions.

Most families are trying
to do the best they can
for their children.
Help families feel
­confident and good
about giving care.

Course objectives
At the end of the course on Counsel the Family on Care for Development,
you will be able to:

• Identify the interaction between a child and a parent or other person – the primary

c­ aregiver – who most directly takes care of the child.
• Counsel the family on activities to strengthen the relationship between the child and the
caregiver.
• Advise the family on appropriate play and communication activities to stimulate the
child’s growth and healthy development.
As you learn these tasks, you will focus on observing caregivers with their children.
Using good communication skills, you will counsel the family.

Course methods and materials
In this course, you will read about, observe, and practise counselling
the family and others who care for a young child.
The course provides these materials:

child’s development. With the counselling cards as a job aid, you will be able to give
­c aregivers advice on new play and communication activities as the child grows.
You do not need to memorize the recommendations. You will be able to refer to the card
whenever you counsel a caregiver.

Participant Manual
Introduction

Other materials
The facilitator will use videotapes and other materials to introduce and review the counselling
tasks.
You will have several opportunities to practise what you are learning: in discussion, exercises,
games, and role plays in the classroom; and skill practise with caregivers and their children.
Using the checklist and the counselling cards, you will counsel care­givers at home, in clinics,
or in other settings:

•

Look, ask and listen: find out how the caregivers and children interact, and how
caregivers play and communicate with their children.

•

Praise: encourage caregivers and build their ­confidence to continue doing specific
­activities with their children and, in general, their good efforts.

•

Advise: suggest ways to improve what caregivers do with their children, if necessary.

•

Solve problems: identify any difficulties the caregivers might have, and help them
solve problems.

•

Check understanding: find out what the caregivers understand and remember, in
order to be sure that they will be able to improve the child’s care at home.

Some participants may have taken a course in Integrated ­Management
of Childhood Illness (IMCI). IMCI-trained health workers work in
­acute-care centres. They may counsel caregivers of children on care for
child development, only if the children are low-weight or have anaemia.
Their time working with sick children in the health facility may not
permit counselling caregivers of all children under five years old.
Other counsellors may use these guidelines with families of all ­children,
sick or well, in a wide variety of settings.

Care for Child Development

Who is the caregiver?
The caregiver is the most important person to the young child. The caregiver feeds and watches
over the child, gives the child affection, communicates with the child, and responds to the
child’s needs. If the child is sick, the caregiver is usually the person who takes the child to a
health-care provider.

Photos J. Lucas

Who are caregivers in your community? Often the caregiver is the child’s mother. The mother
is the primary – most important – caregiver to a young infant who is breastfeeding.

TIP
Greet care­givers in a friendly way
­whenever and wherever you see
them.
By building good ­relationships
with ­caregivers, you will be able
to improve the lives of children
in your community.

4

The primary caregiver may also be the father or another family member.
When both parents are sick or absent, the child’s caregiver may be a
relative or neighbour.
In some communities, children have several caregivers. A g­ randmother,
an aunt, an older sister, and a neighbour may share the tasks of caring for
a child. Also, a child-care centre may have s­ everal caregivers who take
care of children a few hours each day. In this training, the primary caregivers
are considered the child’s family.
You may meet these caregivers in different settings. You may be working or
volunteering, for example, in a child-care centre, at a feeding programme,
in a health centre or hospital, or at a community health fair. Wherever you
are called on to counsel families, your efforts will help them raise healthier
and more capable children.

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual

Caring for the child’s development
Children become more capable as they grow older. They learn to talk, walk, and run. They learn
to think and solve problems.
This learning helps them to do well in school and, when they grow up, to contribute to their
families and communities. These changes are examples of the development of the child.
The recommendations on Care for Child Development are for all c­ hildren. They describe what
mothers and fathers, and others who care for the young
child, can do.
The recommendations provide ideas for play and
communication activities to help children learn. Feeding,
dressing, and other daily tasks provide many opportunities
for adults to play and communicate with their children.
The recommendations also help children grow. For this
reason, the recommendations are especially important for
low-weight newborns and malnourished children. Studies
have found that extra attention through play and
communication, as well as through responsive feeding,
stimulates the growth of low-weight babies and poorly
nourished children.
Low-weight babies and children who are poorly nourished also have
difficulty learning. They may be timid and easily upset, harder to feed,
and less likely to play and communicate.
Since these children are less active, they may be less able to get the
attention of the adults who care for them. As a result, over time mothers
and other caregivers are less likely to feed, play with, or communicate
frequently with them.
Poorly nourished, sick, and disabled children all have special needs
for care. Their families may also need help to understand how their
children communicate their hunger, discomfort, and needs.
The recommendations for play and communication can also help
caregivers. After giving birth, for example, some mothers find it difficult
to become active and involved in caring for their newborn babies. They
may be sick or overwhelmed with their responsibilities. They appear
sad and tired. They are uninterested in other people and do not join other family activities.
Paying close attention to their babies, playing with them, and seeing how their babies respond
to the attention helps these caregivers become more active and happier. The recommended
play and communication activities help caregivers feel more important in the lives of their young
children. The activities help both the child and the caregiver.

Care for Child Development

Caring for the child’s development

All children will grow healthier with the extra attention during play and communication activities,
and they will be better able to learn. Their families will be happy to see how their children grow
and learn new skills.

What is care for child development?
Each child is unique at birth, and the differences among children affect how they learn. Their
early care also affects their learning. Experiences during the first years with their families and
other caregivers greatly affect the kind of adults children will become.
Families give their children special care for development by giving them love, attention, and
many opportunities to learn. By playing and communicating with their children, families help
their children grow healthier and stronger. Children learn to communicate their needs, solve
problems, and help others. From a very young age, children learn important skills that will
prepare them for life.

• Much of what children learn, they learn when they are very young
The brain develops most rapidly before birth and during the first two years of life. Good nutrition and good health are especially important during this time. Breast milk plays a special role
in the development of the brain. Breast milk also helps young children stay free from illness so
that they are strong and can explore and learn.
Children can see and hear at birth. Starting when they are very young, children need opportunities
to use their eyes and ears, in addition to good nutrition. For their brains to develop, children
also need to move, to have things to touch and explore, and to play with others. Children also
need love and affection. All these experiences help the brain to develop.

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual
Caring for the child’s development

• Children need a safe environment as they learn
Children are always exploring new things and learning new skills. They need a clean, safe, and
protected physical environment to be safe from injuries and accidents while they are playing
and learning.
Children also should be protected from violence and strong anger aimed at them and around
them. Adults need to protect young children from physical harm and harsh criticism, in order
to help children gain confidence to explore and learn.
When children are young, they often explore by putting things into their sensitive mouths. With
their mouths, as well as with their hands, children learn what is soft and hard, hot and cold, dry
and moist, and rough and smooth.
Families must be sure that the things that young children
put into their mouths are large enough so that they cannot
swallow them. Also, they should not let children put long,
thin, or sharp objects into their mouths.
Any object a child plays with should be clean. Putting the
child on a clean blanket or mat helps to keep playthings
clean.
When a child wants to play with something that is not safe
or not clean, the caregiver may have to gently say “no”.
While the child is learning, it is helpful to exchange the
object for something that is safe and clean. Children can be
easily distracted from things they should not do by drawing
their interest towards other activities.

• Children need consistent loving attention from at least one person
To feel safe, young children need to have a special relationship with at least one person who can
give them love and attention. The sense that they belong to a family will help them get along
well with others. It will also give them confidence to learn.
Children naturally want to communicate with another person from birth. They become especially
close to the caregivers who feed them, spend time communicating with them, and give them
love and affection.
During breastfeeding, a baby and mother are very close. They communicate by responding to
the slightest movement and sound, even smell, of the other person. This special responsiveness
is like a dance. The baby becomes “attached” to the person who consistently holds her, loves
her, and helps her feel safe. This connection or bond lasts a lifetime.
Sometimes the mother and baby have difficulty developing this special connection. You can
help mothers and other caregivers understand what their babies are trying to do as they begin
to communicate, and help the caregiver respond appropriately. You can help caregivers learn
what they can do to encourage the efforts of their children to play and communicate.
Adults can encourage their children by responding to their children’s words, actions, and interests
with sounds, gestures, gentle touches, and words. Adults can help their children develop into

happy, healthy people by looking at and talking about the attempts of young children to do new
things, to make sounds and to talk, even when the children are not yet able to speak.

• Children learn by playing and trying things out, and by observing and copying
what others do

Children are curious. They want to find out how they can change and affect people and things
around them, even from the first months of age.
Play is like children’s “work”. Play gives children many
opportunities to think and solve problems. Children are
the first scientists.
Children can learn by playing with pots and pans, cups and
spoons, and other clean household items. They learn by
banging, dropping, and putting things in and taking things
out of containers. Children learn by stacking things up and
watching things fall, and testing the sounds of different
objects by hitting them together.
Children learn a lot from doing things themselves. Learning
to use an eating tool without spilling, for example, helps to
develop physical skills.
Children also learn by copying what others do. For example,
if a mother wants her child to eat a different food, she needs to show the child by eating the
food herself. For a child to learn to be polite and respectful, a father needs to be polite and
respectful to his child.

Recommendations for
Care for Child Development
The Counselling Card recommends play and communication activities to encourage and s­ timulate
the child’s physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development.
Some examples of new skills the young child is developing are, for example:

• Physical (or motor) – learning to reach and grab for an object, and to stand and walk.
• Social – learning to communicate what is needed and use words to talk to another person.
• Cognitive – learning to think and solve problems, to compare sizes and shapes, and to
recognize people and things.

• Emotional – learning to calm oneself when upset, be patient when learning a new skill, be
happy, and make others happy.

Discuss with the facilitator:
A caregiver helps a child learn to stack cups of different sizes.
What are some skills that the child is learning?

▪ Physical (or motor) skills
▪ Social skills
▪ Cognitive skills
▪ Emotional skills
Some approaches to promoting child development focus on what the child does or should be
able to do at a particular age.
The recommendations on the counselling card, instead, focus on the care the child receives.
They suggest play and communication activities to help families stimulate the development
of the child’s skills. At different ages, a child needs opportunities to learn new skills. The
­recommendations for play and communication change and become more complex as the child
grows older. (See the six age groups on the Counselling Cards with Recommendations for Care
for Child Development.)
The activities also help the family learn how to care for the child. Through play and communication
with the child from birth, the caregiver learns to be sensitive to the child’s needs and to respond
appropriately to the child’s attempts to communicate.
The basic caregiving skills – sensitivity and responsiveness – help the mother, father, and
other caregivers provide better care for the child. They contribute to the child’s survival, as well
as to the child’s healthy growth and development.
A sensitive caregiver is aware of the child and recognizes what a child is trying to communicate,
for example, hunger, pain and discomfort, interest in something, or affection. A responsive
caregiver then acts immediately and appropriately to what the child is trying to communicate.
10

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual
Recommendations

A sensitive and responsive caregiver would, for example, have the skills to be able to see the
child’s signs of discomfort, recognize that the child is hungry, and feed her. The skills help the
caregiver be aware when the child may be in danger and then move quickly to protect him.
The skills help the caregiver feel when the child is in distress, and respond appropriately to
give comfort. The skills help caregivers recognize when a child is sick and needs medical care.
As a counsellor, you need to understand all the care recommendations for children from birth
up to age five years. But you do not need to memorize them. Instead, you will refer to the
Counselling Cards when you meet with caregivers.
Also, you will not need to explain all the recommendations to care­givers.
During this course you will learn to select the recommendations that
are appropriate for the child’s age and for the problems with care that
you identify. But first we will discuss recommendations on play and
communication for all children according to their age group.

• Select recommended activities appropriate for the child’s age
There are play and communication recommendations for children in six
age groups. If the child is almost at the end of an age group, however,
you might discuss the recommendations for the next age group. For
example, a child who is almost 12 months old could learn activities
recommended for children age 12 months up to 2 years.

• Select recommended activities appropriate for the child’s skill
If a child is able to do an activity recommended for his or her age, then
introduce an activity for the next older age group.

• Select recommended activities appropriate for the problems in
caregiver–child interactions that you identify

For example, a caregiver might have difficulty responding to a child. Recommend an activity to
help the caregiver pay close attention to what the child does and respond to it. A game to copy
what the child does can help the caregiver learn to pay attention and respond more closely to
what the child is doing.
The discussion on recommendations for play and communication for each age group follows.

Recommendations

NEWBORN,
BIRTH UP TO 1 WEEK
Your baby learns
from birth

For the newborn, from birth up to 1 week
Play: Healthy babies can see, hear, and smell at birth. Right away they
begin to recognize their mothers. They soon start to smile when people
smile at them. Faces are particularly interesting.
At this age, learning is through seeing, hearing, feeling, and moving.
The child’s face should not be covered for long periods of time because
children need to see in order for their eyesight to develop.

PLAY Provide ways for
your baby to see, hear, move
arms and legs freely, and
touch you. Gently soothe,
stroke and hold your child.
Skin to skin is good.

Wrapping the newborn tightly – swaddling – is common in some places.
Newborns should not be tightly bound in clothing for long periods,
however, because they need to be able to move and touch people and
things.
Instead, encourage the mother and father to hold their child closely.
They can gently stroke the child’s skin. By gently soothing an upset
child, they also help the child learn to soothe herself.
Communicate: Encourage families to talk to their children from birth
– even before. When a mother looks at her child’s eyes, and smiles in
response to the child’s smiles, the child learns to communicate. And
the mother begins to see her child respond to her. Encourage the father
also to communicate with the newborn.

COMMUNICATE
Look into baby’s eyes and
talk to your baby. When you
are breastfeeding is a good
time. Even a newborn baby
sees your face and hears
your voice.

Children communicate their needs. They learn to trust that someone
will pay attention to their movements, sounds, and cries. Breastfeeding
on demand strengthens this interaction and the growing trust.
Children show interest in breastfeeding by becoming fussy, sucking
their hand, or moving their heads toward the breast. Using these clues,
a mother can learn to recognize that a child is hungry before the child
starts to cry.

WHO CAH

By looking into his newborn’s eyes,
the father communicates with his child.
He enjoys being involved in the
child’s life from the very ­beginning.

12

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual
Recommendations

For the infant, from 1 week
up to 6 months

1 WEEK UP
TO 6 MONTHS

Play: Infants at this age like to reach for and grab fingers and objects.
They look at their hands and feet, as if they are just discovering them.
They put things into their mouths because their mouths are sensitive.
The mouth helps them learn warm and cool, and soft and hard, by taste
and touch. Just make sure that what the child puts into his mouth is
clean, and is large enough that the child won’t choke on it.
Help the child follow an object. For example, ask the caregiver to show
a colourful cup to the child, just out of reach. When she is sure the
child sees the cup, ask her to move it slowly from one side to the other
and up and down, in front of the child. Then, to move the cup closer.
Encourage the child to reach for the cup and grab the handle.

PLAY Provide ways for your
child to see, hear, feel, move
freely, and touch you. Slowly
move colourful things for
your child to see and reach
for. Sample toys: shaker rattle,
big ring on a string.

COMMUNICATE
Smile and laugh with your
child. Talk to your child. Get
a conversation going by
copying your child’s sounds
or gestures.

Clean, safe, and colourful things from the household, such as a wooden spoon or plastic bowl,
can be given to the child to reach for and touch. A simple, homemade toy, like a shaker rattle,
can attract the child’s interest by the sounds it makes.
Children this age also continue to love to see people and faces. Encourage family members to
hold and carry the child.
Communicate: Children enjoy making new sounds, like squeals and laughs. They respond to
someone’s voice with more sounds, and they copy sounds they hear. They start to learn about
how to make a ­conversation with another person before they can say words.
All family members can smile, laugh, and talk to the child. They can “coo” and copy the child’s
sounds. Copying the child’s sounds and movements helps the people who care for the child
pay close attention to the child. They learn to understand what the child is communicating,
and respond to the interests and needs of the child.

13

Participant Manual

Care for Child Development

Recommendations

These are important caregiving skills – being sensitive to the child’s signs and responding
appropriately to them. These caregiving skills help family members notice when the child is
hungry, or sick, or unhappy, or at risk of getting hurt. They are better able to respond to the
child’s needs.
For the child, this practice in communicating helps the child prepare for talking later. The family
will also enjoy the reactions they get from the child and the attempts at communicating.

Copying the child’s sounds
and gestures starts a good
­communication game.
It helps the mother learn to look
closely at the child, be sensitive
to the child’s sounds and
­movements, and follow –
respond to – the child’s lead.

WHO CAH

And even before the child is able
to speak, he delights in being
able to communicate through
his sounds and movements.

14

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual
Recommendations

For the child, from 6 months
up to 9 months

6 MONTHS
UP TO 9 MONTHS

Play: Children enjoy making noises by hitting or banging with a cup and
other objects. They may pass things from hand to hand and to other
family members, dropping them to see where they fall, what sounds
they make, or if someone will pick them up.
This may be frustrating for busy mothers and fathers. Caregivers can
be more patient if you help them understand that their child is learning
through this play. “Your child is being a little scientist. She is
experimenting with how objects fall, how to make a noise, how the
force of her arm sends the object across the table.”

Communicate: Even before children say words, they learn from what
family members say to them, and can understand a lot. They notice
when people express strong anger, and may be upset by it.

PLAY Give your child
clean, safe household
things to handle, bang,
and drop. Sample toys:
containers with lids, metal
pot and spoon.

COMMUNICATE
Respond to your child’s
sounds and ­interests. Call
the child’s name, and see
your child respond.

Children copy the sounds and actions of older brothers and sisters and
adults. Children like other people to respond to the sounds they are
making and to show an interest in the new things they notice.
A child can recognize his name before he can say it. Hearing his name
helps him know that he is a special person in the family. When he hears
his name, he will look to see who is saying it. He will reach out to the
person who kindly calls his name.

15

Participant Manual

Care for Child Development

Recommendations

9 MONTHS
UP TO 12 MONTHS

For the child, from 9 months
up to 12 months
Play: Play continues to be a time for children to explore and learn about
themselves, the people around them, and the world. As children
discover their toes, they may find them as interesting to touch as a toy.
When a box disappears under a cloth, where does it go? Is it still there?
Can they find it?

PLAY Hide a child’s
favourite toy under a cloth
or box. See if the child can
find it. Play peek-a-boo.

Children also enjoy playing peek-a-boo. When the father disappears
behind a tree, they laugh as father reappears. They enjoy hiding under
a cloth and giggle when the father “finds” them.
Communicate: Even though children cannot yet speak, they show that
they understand what the family members say. They hear the name
of things, and delight in knowing what they are. They begin to connect
the word bird to the bird in the tree, and the word nose to their nose.

WHO CAH

COMMUNICATE
Tell your child the names
of things and people.
Show your child how to
say things with hands, like
“bye bye”. Sample toy: doll
with face.

“Where is your nose?” Nora does not yet speak – but she can show you
where her nose is. She is also learning the names of people and things.
16

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual
Recommendations

All members of the family can enjoy sharing new things with the young child. They can play
simple hand games together, like “bye-bye”, and clap to the beat of music.
A child may become afraid on losing sight of a familiar caregiver. The adult helps the child feel
safe, responds when she cries or is hungry, and calms her by his presence and the sound of his
voice. Encourage the caregiver to tell his child when he is leaving and to reassure his child that
he will soon return. He can leave a safe, comfortable object with the child – one that reminds
the child of the caregiver and assures the child that he will return.

Care for Child Development

Recommendations

For the child, from 12 months
up to 2 years

12 MONTHS
UP TO 2 YEARS

Play: If children this age are healthy and well nourished, they become
more active. They move around and want to explore.
They enjoy playing with simple things from the household or from
nature, and do not need store-bought toys. They like to put things into
cans and boxes, and then take them out. Children like to stack things
up until they fall down. Families can use safe household items to play
with their children.
PLAY Give your child
things to stack up, and to put
into containers and take
out. Sample toys: Nesting and
stacking objects, c­ ontainer and
clothes clips.

Children need encouragement as they try to walk, play new games,
and learn new skills.
Families can encourage their children to learn by watching what they
do and naming it: “You are filling the boxes.” Adults should play with
the children and offer help: “Let’s do it together. Here are more stones
to put into your box.”
When children learn a new game or skill, they repeat it over and over
again. These discoveries make them happy and more confident. They
are especially happy when they see that they are making the adults
around them happy, too. Encourage family members to notice and
praise their young children for what they are learning to do.

COMMUNICATE
Ask your child simple
­questions. Respond to your
child’s attempts to talk.
Show and talk about nature,
pictures and things.

Participant Manual
Recommendations

Communicate: At this age, children learn to understand words and begin to speak. Mothers
and fathers should use every opportunity to have conversations with the child, when feeding
and bathing the child, and when working near the child.
Children are beginning to understand what others are saying and can follow simple d
­ irections.
They often can say some words, such as “water” or “ball”. Family members should try to
­understand the child’s words and check to see whether they understand what the child says:
“Would you like some water?” “Do you want to play with the ball?”
Families can play simple word games, and ask simple questions: “Where is your toe?” or “Where
is the bird?” Together they can look at pictures and talk about what they see.
Adults should use kind words to soothe a hurt child and praise the child’s efforts.

A child enjoys playing
with ­homemade toys,
and will learn by grabbing,
shaking, banging,
and stacking them.

Recommendations

2 YEARS
AND OLDER

For the child, 2 years and older
Play: Children 2 years and older learn to name things and to count.
A caregiver can help her child to learn to count by asking “how many”
and counting things together. Children make mistakes at first, but learn
from repeating the games many times.
Children still enjoy playing with simple, homemade toys. They do not
need store-bought toys. They can learn to draw with chalk on a stone
or with a stick in the sand. Picture puzzles can be made by cutting
magazine pictures or simple drawings into large pieces.

PLAY Help your child
count, name and compare
things. Make simple toys
for your child. Sample toys:
Objects of different colours
and shapes to sort, stick or
chalk board, puzzle.

COMMUNICATE
Encourage your child to
talk and answer your child’s
questions. Teach your
child stories, songs and
games. Talk about pictures
or books. Sample toy: book
with pictures

20

Children can learn to match colours,
shapes, and sizes with simple objects,
such as bottle caps. They can compare
and sort circles and other shapes cut
from coloured paper.

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual
Recommendations

Communicate: By age 2 years, children can listen and understand. Asking simple questions and
listening to the answers encourages children to talk: “What is this?” “Where is your brother?”
“Which ball is bigger?” “Would you like the red cup?”
Looking at picture books and reading stories to children prepares them for reading. Stories,
songs, and games also help children improve how they speak.
Answering a child’s questions encourages the child to explore the world. Family members should
try – with patience – to answer a young child’s many questions.
Children who are learning to talk make many mistakes. Correcting them, however, will dis­courage
talking. They will learn to speak correctly by copying – by listening to others who speak correctly.
Children this age can understand what is right and wrong. Traditional stories, songs, and games
help teach children how to behave. Children also copy their older brothers and sisters and other
family members as they learn what is right and wrong.
Children learn better when they are taught how to behave well instead of being scolded for
behaving badly. They should be corrected gently so that they do not feel ashamed.

Throughout the activity, encourage care­givers to help their children learn.
Some good advice for the caregiver, no matter what the child’s age:
Give your child affection and show your love.

•
• Be aware of your child’s interests and respond to them.
• Praise your child for trying to learn new skills.

Exercise: Making toys

Demonstration
Your facilitator will show you some homemade toys and other household objects that children
might play with. For each item, consider:

1. How attractive is it (colour, size, and sound) for a young child?
2. How easily could the young child hold it?
3. How does the size, and whether it is sharp or dull, or edible, affect its safety? How safe is
it for children in different age groups? Refer to the age groups on the Counselling Cards.
4. What age child would most like it?
Note that the same toys may be attractive to children of different ages. A young child
might enjoy dropping stones in a plastic bottle. An older child might use the same stones
to count as she drops the stones in the plastic bottle.
5. What might the child learn by using it? Consider physical, social, emotional,
and intellectual skills the child might learn.
6. How could playing with the toy affect the interaction between the caregiver and child?

Counsel the family
on Care for Child Development
Now we are ready to use these recommendations for play and communication to counsel a
caregiver. We will also learn to observe the caregivers with their children in order to observe
patterns of sensitive and responsive caregiving. The Checklist will guide us as we counsel the
family.

Greet the caregiver and child
You will see caregivers in the home, in a clinic, or in another place where families gather. Greet
the caregiver. Invite the caregiver to sit with the child in a comfortable place while you ask some
questions. Sit close, talk softly, and look directly at the caregiver and child. Communicate clearly
and warmly throughout the meeting.
Ask questions to gather information on the child and the caregiver. Listen carefully to the
caregiver’s answers. The answers will help you counsel the caregiver about how to encourage
the child’s development.
You will focus the counselling on what the child needs. To identify the child’s needs, observe
how the caregiver and child interact. Ask the caregiver questions about the child’s care.
The Checklist for Counselling on Care for Child Development guides you as you learn this
information and counsel the family. It helps you understand how the caregiver responds to the
child. It helps you provide appropriate advice, focused on the child’s age and specific
developmental needs.
To begin, look at the top of the checklist on the next page. What do you know about the child
in the sample?

Discuss with the facilitator:
When did the counsellor see the child and the caregiver?
What is the name of the counsellor?
What is the child’s name?
How old is the child?
Is the child a boy or a girl?
What is the caregiver’s name?
What is the relationship of the caregiver to the child?
Where do they live?

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual

Look, ask, and listen:
Identify care practices
The next section of the Checklist provides questions to find out how the caregiver and child
interact, and how the caregiver stimulates the child’s development through play and
communication activities.
The questions are in three sections from the top of the table to the bottom.

• Top: For all children
• Middle: For the child age less than 6 months
• Bottom: For the child age 6 months and older
(IMPORTANT: If the child appears to be very weak and sick, then refer the child immediately
to the closest health facility – hospital or clinic. Do not take time now to counsel the caregiver
on Care for Child Development.)
Listen carefully for the caregiver’s answers to the questions. You may look at the
­Recommendations for Caring for Your Child’s Development for the child’s age, as you listen.
If an answer is unclear, ask another question.
Record the answer where there is a blank. Write a brief answer, for example:

• How does the caregiver show he or she is aware of the child’s movements?
Looks at child, shifts and holds child closer

• How does caregiver comfort the child?

Puts child’s head on shoulder and pats back

For all children
First, look at the caregiver and child. You can observe them from the moment you first see them.

• Look: How does the caregiver show he or she is aware of the child’s movements?
Many caregivers are unaware that they are reacting to the child, her moods, and her movements.
But, as the child moves, the caregiver’s hand feels the child turn. The caregiver might look at a
child who walks away to be reassured that the child is okay.
If the child fusses, a gentle hand taps the child’s back to soothe her. You are often able to see
this strong connection between a caregiver and child. It usually develops when the child is very
young, even in the first days of life.
Sometimes, however, you do not see this connection. There may be many reasons. The mother
may be sick. She and her infant may have been separated at birth, at an important time for
forming this connection. Fathers who have not had a chance to play with and care for their
newborn may have difficulty developing this connection.
29

Participant Manual

Care for Child Development

Look, ask, listen: Identify care practices

•

Look: How does the caregiver comfort the child and show love?

A young child expresses his discomfort by fussing, crying, and wiggling. Observe
whether the child who is awake follows his mother or other caregiver’s sounds
and movements. Notice also how the caregiver responds when the child reaches
for her or looks to her for comfort.
The caregiver comforts her child by gently talking to him. A child who hurts his
knee wants to know that his mother feels it too. The caregiver might draw the
child more closely to comfort and protect him.
Children who are afraid of new people, places, and sounds may need to be held
until they know that their mother and father feel safe too. Children learn how
to calm themselves by the reaction they get from others. A loud or threatening
noise further upsets them. A calm voice helps to calm them.

• Look: How does the caregiver correct the child?

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual

Praise and advise:
Improve care practices
With the information you learn from the caregiver, you are able to give specific praise to
encourage the family to play and communicate with the child, and to strengthen their basic
caregiving skills. You also can identify possible problems. With the recommendations on the
Counselling Cards, you can focus your advice on how to improve the child’s care.

Praise the caregiver
Most families try to do their best for their children. Praise recognizes the effort. Praise for the
effort to play and communicate with children from birth encourages families to continue doing
what is best for their children. Praise also builds confidence. Confidence will help the family
learn new activities to try with their child.
The Checklist identifies some behaviours to praise. You might praise the caregiver for holding
her child closely, and talking and playing with her child.
Praise shows the caregiver that you see the good effort. Praise can also show how the child
praises the caregiver’s good effort.
For example, when caregivers look at their children and talk softly to them, help them notice
the good reaction they get from their children. For example: “Notice how your baby responds
when he hears his name. He turns to you. He recognizes and loves your voice.”

Discuss with the facilitator:
A mother gently massages her newborn. She stretches out her baby’s arms and legs,
and pushes them back again.
How would you praise the mother?

Advise the caregiver
When you counsel a family you have an opportunity to strengthen the skills of the people who
care for young children.
They may not know why their child does not respond to them as they wish. They may not know
that you should talk to a small child, even before he or she can speak. Sometimes families think
that play is only for children. When the child is old enough, she will play with her bigger brothers
and sisters. They do not know that adults who play with their young infants and children are
helping them to learn, and they do not know what kind of play is appropriate for the child.

33

Participant Manual

Care for Child Development

Praise and advise: Improve care practices

The Checklist identifies some common problems and what you can s­ uggest to help families
in caring for their children. You will guide the caregiver and child in practising the play and
­communication activities with you. For example:

• To help a caregiver respond to the child
You might find that a caregiver does not move easily with
her child and does not know how to comfort her child. You
do not see the close connection between what the child
does and how the caregiver responds.
This connection is the basis for sensitive and responsive
caregiving. Where it is missing, you can help the caregiver
learn to look closely at what a young child is doing and to
respond directly to it. Ask the caregiver to:

1. Look into the child’s face until their eyes meet.
2. Notice the child’s every movement and sound.
3. Copy the child’s movements and sounds.

Soon, most young children also begin to copy the caregiver.

It is important that the
counsellor not do the activities
directly with the child. ­Connecting
with you, the counsellor, will interfere
with the child making the ­connection
with the caregiver.
Instead, teach or coach the ­caregiver
through the activity with the child.

One time is not enough. Encourage the caregiver and child to play this
communication game every day. Help the caregiver see how the child
enjoys it. Notice how satisfied the caregiver is with the a­ ttention the
child gives her.

• To help a caregiver speak less harshly to a child
Sometimes children annoy adults as they try new skills. Adults may
think that children should be able to act better than they are able to
act at their age. They may think the child is acting against the adult’s
rules on purpose.

For example, a father might think his child is misbehaving when he drops things again and again.
He scolds his child and perhaps spanks him.
You can help the father see what the child might be thinking in a more positive way: “See what
I can do. I can make it fall, and it makes a noise. The harder I push, the farther it goes. I am
strong. When I drop it near Daddy, I am asking him to play with me, and we laugh and have
fun together. He loves me very much.”

• To introduce a new play or communication activity
In general, introduce a play or communication activity on the Counselling Cards by following
these steps:

34

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual
Praise and advise: Improve care practices

1. Get the child’s attention
Before you start, help the caregiver get the child’s attention. She can look into the child’s eyes,
smile, and make sounds until the child begins to respond to her. She can also move a container
or other object in front of the child until the child reaches for it.
2. Respond to the child
Help the caregiver follow the child’s lead. She can copy the child’s sounds, or respond to the
child’s hand or leg movements. Often the child will then repeat the activity, in order to get the
caregiver to respond again. This increases the child’s attempts to make sounds and move, and
the caregiver’s pleasure. Both are important to help the child learn.
3. Introduce a play or communication activity recommended on the Counselling Cards
When the caregiver and child are responding together, it is now easier to introduce a new
activity.
For example, give stones (large enough not to swallow) and
a plastic jar to a caregiver who takes care of her 14-monthold grandson. Ask her to try to teach her grandchild to put
the stones into the jar. Help her get started, if necessary.
Point out any success, and help her find ways to show her
grandchild that she is pleased.
Also, help her see how much her grandchild seems to enjoy
playing with her. Often children want to repeat this activity
many times, once they have learned it.
Note again that it is important that, as the counsellor, you
do not do this activity directly with the child. Instead help
– or coach – the caregiver to do the activity with the child.
4. Then, state the recommendations on play or
­communication for the child
Recommend that the caregiver continue this activity at
home to help her child learn: “Give your child things to put
into containers and take out, and to stack up. This will help your child learn new skills. This will
help him grow and be ready for school.”
If the child is almost at the end of an age group – or the child already knows how to do the activities
for her age group – you may introduce the recommendations for the next, older age group.
5. Check understanding
Before the caregiver and child leave, be sure you have seen them do the recommended play
or communication activities. This will show you that the caregiver is able to do the activity.
Encourage the caregiver to continue the activities at home.
Also, ask the caregiver questions about how he will do the activity at home. For example, “What
do you have at home to use to teach your boy how to stack things?” “What would you like your
child to learn to name?” “When is a good time to read or talk about pictures and things with
your child?”

35

Care for Child Development

Praise and advise: Improve care practices

Finally, explain to the caregiver the importance of stimulating the child’s development.
One of the following reasons might be important to the child’s family:

• Play and communication, as well as good feeding, will help your child grow healthy
and learn. These activities are especially important in the first years of life.

• Play and communication activities help the brain to grow and make your child smart
and happy.

• Good care for the child’s development will help your child be ready to go to school
and to contribute one day to the family and community.

• Playing and communicating with your child will help build a strong relationship
with your child for life.

Help the caregiver
understand how
important it is

child learn.

confidence to care for
her child at home by

and communicating
with her child.

Care for Child Development

Participant Manual
Praise and advise: Improve care practices

Role play exercise:
Advise the caregiver
The facilitator will divide the participants into groups of four
­participants each. Participants should set up a space with four
chairs, in order to do a role play.
In the small group, decide who will be the caregiver (mother or father),
the child, the counsellor, and the observer. The roles to play are:
Caregiver (mother or father):
You have a 3-year-old child. You want your child to be smart and able to do many things. You
are very interested in what the counsellor is saying about how to help your child.
Child:
You will act as though you are a 3-year-old child. You are a bit shy. But do not act silly (we want
the counsellor to have a good practice). You enjoy your mother and father’s attention.
Counsellor:
Welcome the caregiver and child. Select a play or communication activity appropriate for the
child’s age.
1. Help the caregiver get the child’s attention.
2. Help the caregiver respond to the child.
3. Introduce a play or communication activity recommended on the Counselling Cards for
the child’s age. Help the caregiver practise the activity with the child.
4. Then, state the recommendations on play or communication for the child. Identify the
benefits for the child and for the family.
5. Check the caregiver’s understanding. For example, what items could she use to play with
her child at home? How will she use them?
Observer:
Observe the discussion between the counsellor and the caregiver. At the end of the role play,
provide feedback:
1. How welcoming was the counsellor?
2. How appropriate for the child’s age was the activity the counsellor recommended?
3. How well did the counsellor introduce the caregiver to the activity?
4. Did the counsellor do the activity with the child, or help the caregiver do the activity?
5. How well did the counsellor praise the caregiver? Was the praise specific? Did the praise
provide information on the benefit to the child?
6. How did the counsellor help the caregiver see how the child responded?
When you finish, change roles. Ask the child to be a child from a different age group.
Continue to change roles until each participant has played each role.

37

Participant Manual

Care for Child Development

Help solve problems
After you introduce a caregiver to recommended play and communication activities for the child,
you need to ask: “What difficulties might you have doing these activities at home with your
child?”. Then you can help the caregiver identify solutions that are appropriate for the family.
Refer to the section of the Counselling Cards on Counsel the Family about Problems in Caring
for the Child’s Development. This section lists common problems families face in caring for
their children.
If the mother cannot breastfeed, counsel the mother to:

• Hold the child close when feeding, look at the child, and talk or sing to the child.
Even though breastfeeding is best for children, many children have grown and done well
without breast milk. If the mother cannot breastfeed, help her understand the
importance of responding when the child shows she is hungry. Hold the child
during feeding. For the child to feel safe and secure, it is important to feed the
child with a cup in a loving way, keeping the child close to the body, and looking
into the child’s eyes.
If the caregiver does not know what the child does to play or communicate:

• Remind the caregiver that children play and communicate from birth.
• Demonstrate how the child responds to the caregiver’s activities and effort.
To encourage learning, caregivers need to recognize play and communication, and
understand that they are important for learning.
If a child looks or smiles at the caregiver, remind him that this is how the child communicates.
If the child makes a sound or gesture, encourage the caregiver to imitate it. Often the child will
repeat it with delight. Help the caregiver guess what the child might be trying to communicate.
“My daddy heard me!”, “I can make my daddy laugh!” or “Daddy makes such a funny face with
me!”
Finally, select another activity for the child’s age from the Recommendations for Care for
Child Development. Then help the caregiver try the activity with the child and see how the
child responds.
If the caregiver feels that she is too burdened or stressed to play
and communicate with the child:

• Listen to her feelings.
• Help her identify a key person who can share her feelings and help her with her child.
• Build her confidence by demonstrating her ability to carry out a simple activity. Offer
praise and encourage her to practise the activity with her child.

• Refer her to a local service, if needed and available.

If caregivers feel that they do not have time to play and communicate with the child:

• Encourage them to combine play and communication activities with other care for the
child (for example, feeding, bathing, and dressing).

• Ask other family members to help care for the child or help with the parents’ chores.
Caregivers may feel that they do not have additional time to actively feed, play, or communicate
with their children. Ask the caregiver what she thinks she could do to get more time. If she
needs help to find time, discuss some of these ideas:

• Do play and communication activities while doing household chores or caring for the
child.

She could talk, sing, and play while bathing, feeding, and dressing the child, or while c­ leaning
the house.

•

Identify others in the family who might help her do some of her
work, to give her more time with the young child.

•

Identify others, including the father and older brothers and
sisters, who can spend time playing and talking with the child.

If the caregiver has no toys for her child to play with, counsel her
to:

•
•
•

Use any household objects that are clean and safe.
Make simple toys.
Play with her child. The child will learn by playing with her and
other people.

Young children do not need bought toys. Often children find their own toys in the house or
outside. Help the caregiver identify safe items at home.
For example, for the caregiver of a child age 7 months, ask: “What do you have at home that your
child could safely handle, bang and drop?” For a child age 12 months up to 2 years, ask, “What
kinds of empty containers do you have at home that your child could put small things into?”.
Or ask the caregiver what her child plays with now. Check to make sure that she understands
what is safe for her child to play with.
Families can also make simple, inexpensive toys. A block of wood with painted wheels becomes
a cart. A child can sort circles cut from coloured cardboard to match colours. A picture can be
pasted onto cardboard and cut into three pieces to make a simple picture puzzle. Children can
also play with natural objects, such as seedpods or seashells that are clean and are not sharp.
Children also need people to play with. They learn from playing with fathers, brothers and
sisters, and friends. Identify ways that others can talk to the child, and play counting, naming,
or other games recommended for the child’s age.
If the child is not responding, or seems “slow”:

• Encourage the family to do extra play and communication activities with the child.
• Check to see whether the child is able to see and to hear.

Help solve problems

• Refer the child with difficulties seeing or hearing to special services, if available.
• Encourage the mother and other family members to play and communicate with the child
through touch and movement.

Most children learn to walk, say a few words, and feed themselves by the end of their second
year. Children, however, are very different from each other in how shy or active they are, and
in how fast they learn. A child who is poorly nourished, for example, may be slow to learn new
skills.
It is sometimes helpful to ask the caregiver: “How do you think your child is learning?” or “Do
you have any concerns about how your child is growing or learning?” A parent may be concerned
that her child is slow, compared to other children.
You can help the caregiver give the special attention her child may need. Demonstrate how
she could respond more to her child’s attempts to communicate. If the child smiles or makes a
sound, have her smile or repeat the sound to
see if her child responds. Ask what the child

sounds?

• Does your child make a lot of different sounds (tata, dada,

Seeing
• Does your child look at your eyes?

• Does your child follow a moving object with the head and
eyes?

• Does your child recognize familiar people (like mother,
father, brother, or sister)?

•

Is your child able to grab an object?

If the caregiver does not know an answer, ask to find out. For
example, she can make a noise behind the child’s head. She can
see if the child’s head and eyes will follow a moving pencil. For
the caregiver to check the child’s hearing and seeing, the child
should be calm and not very sick.
If any of the answers to these questions is “no,” the child
may have difficulties hearing or seeing. If special services for
children are available in your area, refer the child for further
assessment.

40

A child who is slow to learn, however, may
have special difficulties hearing or seeing. If
you think this might be the case, and the child
is six months or older, ask the caregiver the
questions in the box.
If there are special educational services for the
child, refer the child to them for assessment
and care.
Whether or not the child can be referred,
encourage the family to play and communicate
often with the child. Children can learn from
many sources: touch, taste, smell, and body
movements. Discuss who in the family and
community could help the child.
If the mother or father has to leave the child
with someone else for a period of time:
Identify at least one person who can
care for the child regularly, and give the child
love and attention.

•

Care for Child Development

Help solve problems

• Get the child used to being with the new person gradually.
• Encourage the mother and father to spend time with the child when possible.
A child may also lose a parent from illness or another reason. Expect that, with good care, the
child can recover from the loss of a parent. Children often go through a period of sadness if they
lose or rarely see their mothers or fathers. However, with time they learn to love other people,
and most can recover from their sadness. Help identify one special person who will give the
child love and extra attention as soon as possible after a loss.
If it seems that the child is being treated harshly:
Recommend better ways of dealing with the child.

• Encourage the family to always look for opportunities to praise the child for good behaviour.

• Respect the child’s feelings. Try to understand why the child is sad or angry.
• Give the child choices about what to do, instead of saying “don’t”.
Children make mistakes as they explore and try new things to do. They may look like they are
misbehaving or are trying to annoy the busy adults around them. Their caregivers may believe
punishing children is the best way to help them learn what is right and wrong. They may treat
their children harshly.
While a caregiver plays and communicates with his child is a good time to demonstrate better
ways of dealing with the child. Encourage the caregiver to see and praise his child for his good
efforts. Help him interpret what the child might be seeing, thinking, and trying to do. If the child
becomes upset, help the caregiver try to find out what is making the child upset. If the child
takes something that is not his or in other ways misbehaves, help the caregiver find another,
appropriate object to play with. Help distract the child with another activity.
When you are done counselling the caregiver, complete the Checklist. Tick [ü] the boxes
to ­indicate the advice you gave and the problems you discussed with the caregiver. See the
­example on the next page.

Discuss with your facilitator:
What do you know about Carlos and his caregiver, Miss Sanchez?
See the top of the checklist.
For what did the counsellor praise Miss Sanchez?
What advice did the counsellor give Miss Sanchez?
Refer to the Counselling Cards. What activities could the counsellor recommend
for Miss Sanchez to do with Carlos? Why?

Role play exercise:
Help solve problems

The facilitator will divide the group into groups of three participants each. Set up a space with
three chairs each, in order to do a role play. In the group, decide who will be the counsellor, the
caregiver (mother or father), and the observer. For the child, give a doll or other object (e.g.
folded towel) to the caregiver. The roles to play are:
Counsellor:
Welcome the caregiver and child. Ask the caregiver if she or he will have any problems playing
and communicating with their child at home. Help the caregiver solve any problems that he
or she might have.
Caregiver (mother or father):
The counsellor has recommended activities for you do with your child. However, it will be
difficult for you to follow the advice for one of the reasons below. Select one of the problems
to discuss with the counsellor.
1. I don’t have time. I have to walk a long distance – one hour to the river and one hour back
– to get water in the morning. By the time I return I have many household chores to do.
2. We don’t have any toys at home. We need the cups and plates and other items for ourselves.
3. My child does not like to play. He just throws his things on the ground and is very annoying.
4. My child is very slow. She does not seem to be learning like the other children.
Observer:
Observe the discussion between the counsellor and the caregiver. At the end of the role play,
provide feedback:
1. How welcoming was the counsellor?
2. How well did the counsellor show concern for the caregiver’s problem? What else could
the counsellor have done?
3. How well did the counsellor help the caregiver find a solution? Was it a good solution for
the family?
Change roles three times, so that each participant performs each role once. The caregiver
should select a different problem from the list of four problems.

Care for Child Development

Caregiver and child follow-up
You can help caregivers try new activities by asking to see them again. Knowing that they will see
you again helps them start the new activities right away. When they return, they will be proud
to show you what they have learned to do and how their children enjoy the activities with them.
Ask the caregiver to bring the child back for follow-up in one week, if you think that they need
this additional support. The follow-up visit is most important when caregivers are just learning
to interact well with their children.
On the bottom of the checklist, circle the day of the planned follow-up visit as a reminder. (See
the sample Checklist for Carlos Sanchez, on page 42.)
During the follow-up visit, ask the caregiver to show you what they have been doing with their
child at home. Praise them for their efforts. Advise them on additional activities to encourage
their interest.
Finally, help the caregiver see how the child enjoys doing the activities with him or her.
